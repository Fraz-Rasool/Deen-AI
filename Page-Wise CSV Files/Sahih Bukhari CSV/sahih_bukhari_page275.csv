And some people of Iraq said, ""A judge can pass a judgement according to what he hears or witnesses (the litigant's confession) in the court itself, but if the confession takes place outside the court, he should not pass the judgment unless two witnesses witness the confession."" Some of them said, ""A judge can pass a judgement depending on his knowledge of the case as he is trust-worthy, and that a witness is Required just to reveal the truth. The judge's knowledge is more than the witness."" Some said, ""A judge can judge according to his knowledge only in cases involving property, but in other cases he cannot."" Al-Qasim said, ""A judge ought not to pass a judgment depending on his knowledge if other people do not know what he knows, although his knowledge is more than the witness of somebody else because he might expose himself to suspicion by the Muslims and cause the Muslims to have unreasonable doubt. "" Whereas the prophet dislikeed suspicion, so once he said: She is Safiyyah.",Judgments (Ahkaam),Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih

The Prophet (ﷺ) stood up on the pulpit (Sufyan said he ascended the pulpit), and after glorifying and praising Allah, he said, ""What is wrong with the employee whom we send (to collect Zakat from the public) that he returns to say, 'This is for you and that is for me?' Why didn't he stay at his father's and mother's house to see whether he will be given gifts or not? By Him in Whose Hand my life is, whoever takes anything illegally will bring it on the Day of Resurrection by carrying it over his neck: if it is a camel, it will be grunting: if it is a cow, it will be mooing: and if it is a sheep it will be bleating!"" The Prophet (ﷺ) then raised both his hands till we saw the whiteness of his armpits (and he said), ""No doubt! Haven't I conveyed Allah's Message?"" And he repeated it three times. Sufyan states that Zuhri narrated this event to us. Hadrat Abu Humaid said: My ears heard and eyes witnessed it, and asked Hadrat Zaid bin Thabit, for he heard it along with me. It has not been reported from Zuhri: My ears heard. ''خُوَارٌ ‏ '' means voice. And '' وَالْجُؤَارُ '' is from '' تَجْأَرُونَ '' i.e. voice like that of a cow.",Judgments (Ahkaam),Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih
