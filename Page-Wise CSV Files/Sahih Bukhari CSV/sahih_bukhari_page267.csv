The other said, ""What was it?"" `AbdurRahman said, ""`Ali رضی اللہ عنہ said, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent for me, Az-Zubair and Abu Marthad, and all of us were cavalry men, and said, 'Proceed to Raudat-Hajj (Abu Salama said that Abu 'Awana called it like this, i.e., Hajj where there is a woman carrying a letter from Hatib bin Abi Balta'a رضی اللہ عنہ to the pagans (of Mecca). So bring that letter to me.' So we proceeded riding on our horses till we overtook her at the same place of which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had told us. She was traveling on her camel. In that letter Hatib رضی اللہ عنہ had written to the Meccans about the proposed attached of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) against them. We asked her, ""Where is the letter which is with you?' She replied, 'I haven't got any letter.' So we made her camel kneel down and searched her luggage, but we did not find anything. My two companions said, 'We do not think that she has got a letter.' I said, 'We know that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has not told a lie.'"" Then `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ took an oath saying, ""By Him by Whom one should swear! You shall either bring out the letter or we shall strip off your clothes."" She then stretched out her hand for her girdle (round her waist) and brought out the paper (letter).

Why (for what reason) should I not believe in Allah and His Apostle?

He has betrayed Allah, His Apostle and the believers; let me chop his neck off!"" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Isn't he from those who fought the battle of Badr? And what do you know, Allah might have looked at them (Badr warriors) and said (to them), 'Do what you like, for I have granted you Paradise?'
