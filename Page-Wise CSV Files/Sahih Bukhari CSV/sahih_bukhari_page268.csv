Some people said, ""If a man, by playing a trick, presents two false witnesses before the judge to testify that he has married a matron with her consent and the judge confirms his marriage, and the husband is sure that he has never married her (before), then such a marriage will be considered as a legal one and he may live with her as husband.""",Tricks,Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih

6972,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to like sweets and also used to like honey, and whenever he finished the `Asr prayer, he used to visit his wives and stay with them. Once he visited Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا and remained with her longer than the period he used to stay, so I enquired about it. It was said to me, ""A woman from her tribe gave her a leather skin containing honey as a present, and she gave some of it to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to drink."" I said, ""By Allah, we will play a trick on him."" So I mentioned the story to Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) رضی اللہ عنہا and said to her, ""When he enters upon you, he will come near to you whereupon you should say to him, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Have you eaten Maghafir?' He will say, 'No.' Then you say to him, 'What is this bad smell? ' And it would be very hard on Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) that a bad smell should be found on his body. He will say, 'Hafsa has given me a drink of honey.' Then you should say to him, 'Its bees must have sucked from the Al-`Urfut (a foul smelling flower).' I too, will tell him the same. And you, O Saifya, say the same."" So when the Prophet (ﷺ) entered upon Sauda (the following happened). Sauda said, ""By Him except Whom none has the right to be worshipped, I was about to say to him what you had told me to say while he was still at the gate because of fear from you. But when Allah 's Apostle came near to me, I said to him, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Have you eaten Maghafir?' He replied, 'No.' I said, 'What about this smell?' He said, 'Hafsa has given me a drink of honey.' I said, 'Its bees must have sucked Al-`Urfut.' "" When he entered upon me, I told him the same as that, and when he entered upon Safiya رضی اللہ عنہا , she too told him the same. So when he visited Hafsa again, she said to him, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Shall I give you a drink of it (honey)?"" He said, ""I have no desire for it."" Sauda رضی اللہ عنہا said, Subhan Allah! We have deprived him of it (honey)."" I said to her, ""Be quiet!""",Tricks,Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih

He said, ""If someone wants to buy a house and being afraid that the neighbor (of the house) may buy it through preemption, he buys one share out of one hundred shares of the house and then buys the rest of the house, then the neighbor can only have the right of preemption for the first share but not for the rest of the house; and the buyer may play such a trick in this case.""",Tricks,Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih

Abu Rafi said, ""I was offered five hundred cash but I refused. Had I not heard the Prophet (ﷺ) saying, 'A neighbor is more entitled to receive the care of his neighbor,' I would not have sold it to you."" The narrator said, to Sufyan: Ma'mar did not say so. Sufyan said, ""But he did say so to me."" Some people said, ""If someone wants to sell a house and deprived somebody of the right of preemption, he has the right to play a trick to render the preemption invalid. And that is by giving the house to the buyer as a present and marking its boundaries and giving it to him. The buyer then gives the seller one-thousand Dirham as compensation in which case the preemptor loses his right of preemption.""",Tricks,Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih
6978,Narrated Abu Rafi':,"Sa'd رضی اللہ عنہ offered him four hundred Mithqal of gold for a house.

6979,Narrated Abu Humaid As-Sa`idi رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) appointed a man called Ibn Al-Lutabiyya to collect the Zakat from Bani Sulaim's tribe. When he returned, the Prophet (ﷺ) called him to account. He said (to the Prophet, 'This is your money, and this has been given to me as a gift."" On that, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""Why didn't you stay in your father's and mother's house to see whether you will be given gifts or not if you are telling the truth?"" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) addressed us, and after praising and glorifying Allah, he said: ""Amma Ba'du"", I employ a man from among you to manage some affair of what Allah has put under my custody, and then he comes to me and says, 'This is your money and this has been given to me as a gift. Why didn't he stay in his father's and mother's home to see whether he will be given gifts or not? By Allah, not anyone of you takes a thing unlawfully but he will meet Allah on the Day of Resurrection, carrying that thing. I do not want to see any of you carrying a grunting camel or a mooing cow or a bleating sheep on meeting Allah."" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) raised both his hands till the whiteness of his armpits became visible, and he said, ""O Allah! Haven't I have conveyed (Your Message)?""

6980,Narrated Abu Rafi` رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""The neighbor has more right to be taken care of by his neighbor (than anyone else)."" Some men said, ""If one wants to buy a house for 20,000 Dirhams then there is no harm to play a trick to deprive somebody of preemption by buying it (just on paper) with 20,000 Dirhams but paying to the seller only 9,999 Dirhams in cash and then agree with the seller to pay only one Dinar in cash for the rest of the price (i.e. 10,001 Dirhams). If the preemptor offers 20,000 Dirhams for the house, he can buy it otherwise he has no right to buy it (by this trick he got out of preemption). If the house proves to belong to somebody else other than the seller, the buyer should take back from the seller what he has paid, i.e., 9,999 Dirhams and one Dinar, because if the house proves to belong to somebody else, so the whole bargain (deal) is unlawful. If the buyer finds a defect in the house and it does not belong to somebody other than the seller, the buyer may return it and receive 20,000 Dirhams (instead of 9999 Dirham plus one Dinar) which he actually paid.' Abu `Abdullah said, ""So that man allows (some people) the playing of tricks amongst the Muslims (although) the Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'In dealing with Muslims one should not sell them sick (animals) or bad things or stolen things.""",Tricks,Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih
6981,Narrated `Amr bin Ash-Sharid:,"Abu Rafi` رضی اللہ عنہ sold a house to Sa`d bin Malik رضی اللہ عنہ for four-hundred Mithqal of gold, and said, ""If I had not heard the Prophet (ﷺ) saying, 'The neighbor has more right to be taken care of by his neighbor (than anyone else),' then I would not have sold it to you.""",Tricks,Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih
6982,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was in the form of good righteous (true) dreams in his sleep. He never had a dream but that it came true like bright day light. He used to go in seclusion (the cave of) Hira where he used to worship(Allah Alone) continuously for many (days) nights. He used to take with him the journey food for that (stay) and then come back to (his wife) Khadija رضی اللہ عنہا to take his food like-wise again for another period to stay, till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him in it and asked him to read. The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, ""I do not know how to read."" (The Prophet (ﷺ) added), ""The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it anymore. He then released me and again asked me to read, and I replied, ""I do not know how to read,"" whereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it anymore. He then released me and asked me again to read, but again I replied, ""I do not know how to read (or, what shall I read?)."" Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me and then released me and said, ""Read: In the Name of your Lord, Who has created (all that exists). Has created man from a clot. Read and Your Lord is Most Generous...up to..... ..that which he knew not."" (96.15) Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) returned with the Inspiration, his neck muscles twitching with terror till he entered upon Khadija رضی اللہ عنہا and said, ""Cover me! Cover me!"" They covered him till his fear was over and then he said, ""O Khadija رضی اللہ عنہا , what is wrong with me?"" Then he told her everything that had happened and said, 'I fear that something may happen to me."" Khadija رضی اللہ عنہا said, 'Never! But have the glad tidings, for by Allah, Allah will never disgrace you as you keep good reactions with your Kith and kin, speak the truth, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guest generously and assist the deserving, calamityafflicted ones."" Khadija رضی اللہ عنہا then accompanied him to (her cousin) Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin `Abdul `Uzza bin Qusai. Waraqa was the son of her paternal uncle, i.e., her father's brother, who during the Pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the Arabic writing and used to write of the Gospels in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija رضی اللہ عنہا said to him, ""O my cousin! Listen to the story of your nephew."" Waraqa asked, ""O my nephew! What have you seen?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, ""This is the same Namus (i.e., Gabriel, the Angel who keeps the secrets) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out."" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, ""Will they turn me out?"" Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said: ""Never did a man come with something similar to what you have brought but was treated with hostility. If I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly."" But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while and the Prophet (ﷺ) became so sad as we have heard that he intended several times to throw himself from the tops of high mountains and every time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself down, Gabriel would appear before him and say, ""O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in truth"" whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as before, but when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him and say to him what he had said before. (Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما said regarding the meaning of: 'He it is that Cleaves the daybreak (from the darkness)' (6.96) that Al-Asbah. means the light of the sun during the day and the light of the moon at night).",Interpretation of Dreams,Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih
