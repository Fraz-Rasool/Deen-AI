"6827, 6828",Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid رضی اللہ عنہما :,"While we were with the Prophet (ﷺ) , a man stood up and said (to the Prophet (ﷺ) ), ""I beseech you by Allah, that you should judge us according to Allah's Laws."" Then the man's opponent who was wiser than him, got up saying (to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)) ""Judge us according to Allah's Law and kindly allow me (to speak)."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""'Speak."" He said, ""My son was a laborer working for this man and he committed an illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, and I gave one-hundred sheep and a slave as a ransom for my son's sin. Then I asked a learned man about this case and he informed me that my son should receive one hundred lashes and be exiled for one year, and the man's wife should be stoned to death."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge you according to the Laws of Allah. Your one-hundred sheep and the slave are to be returned to you, and your son has to receive one-hundred lashes and be exiled for one year. O Unais! Go to the wife of this man, and if she confesses, then stone her to death."" Unais went to her and she confessed. He then stoned her to death. Sufyan says that he also remembers this statement: Beware! Allah's Apostle ﷺ stoned to death; so after him, we stoned to death.",Al-Maharbeen,Sahih Bukhari,8,Sahih
6829,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"`Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I am afraid that after a long time has passed, people may say, ""We do not find the Verses of the Rajam (stoning to death) in the Holy Book,"" and consequently they may go astray by leaving an obligation that Allah has revealed. Lo! I confirm that the penalty of Rajam be inflicted on him who commits illegal sexual intercourse, if he is already married and the crime is proved by witnesses or pregnancy or confession."" Sufyan added, ""I have memorized this narration in this way."" `Umar added, ""Surely Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) carried out the penalty of Rajam, and so did we after him.""",Al-Maharbeen,Sahih Bukhari,8,Sahih
6830,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"I used to teach (the Qur'an to) some people of the Muhajirln (emigrants), among whom there was `Abdur Rahman bin `Auf رضی اللہ عنہ . While I was in his house at Mina, and he was with `Umar bin Al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ during `Umar's last Hajj, `Abdur-Rahman came to me and said, ""Would that you had seen the man who came today to the Chief of the Believers (`Umar رضی اللہ عنہ ), saying, 'O Chief of the Believers! What do you think about so-and-so who says, 'If `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ should die, I will give the pledge of allegiance to such-andsuch person, as by Allah, the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ was nothing but a prompt sudden action which got established afterwards.' `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ became angry and then said, 'Allah willing, I will stand before the people tonight and warn them against those people who want to deprive the others of their rights (the question of rulership). `Abdur-Rahman رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I said, 'O Chief of the believers! Do not do that, for the season of Hajj gathers the riff-raff and the rubble, and it will be they who will gather around you when you stand to address the people. And I am afraid that you will get up and say something, and some people will spread your statement and may not say what you have actually said and may not understand its meaning, and may interpret it incorrectly, so you should wait till you reach Medina, as it is the place of emigration and the place of Prophet's Traditions, and there you can come in touch with the learned and noble people, and tell them your ideas with confidence; and the learned people will understand your statement and put it in its proper place.' On that, `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, 'By Allah! Allah willing, I will do this in the first speech I will deliver before the people in Medina."" Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما added: We reached Medina by the end of the month of Dhul-Hijja, and when it was Friday, we went quickly (to the mosque) as soon as the sun had declined, and I saw Sa`id bin Zaid bin `Amr bin Nufail رضی اللہ عنہ sitting at the corner of the pulpit, and I too sat close to him so that my knee was touching his knee, and after a short while `Umar bin Al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ came out, and when I saw him coming towards us, I said to Sa`id bin Zaid bin `Amr bin Nufail ""Today `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ will say such a thing as he has never said since he was chosen as Caliph."" Sa`id denied my statement with astonishment and said, ""What thing do you expect `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ to say the like of which he has never said before?"" In the meantime, `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ sat on the pulpit and when the callmakers for the prayer had finished their call, `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ stood up, and having glorified and praised Allah as He deserved, he said, ""Now then, I am going to tell you something which (Allah) has written for me to say. I do not know; perhaps it portends my death, so whoever understands and remembers it, must narrate it to the others wherever his mount takes him, but if somebody is afraid that he does not understand it, then it is unlawful for him to tell lies about me. Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth and revealed the Holy Book to him, and among what Allah revealed, was the Verse of the Rajam (the stoning of married person (male & female) who commits illegal sexual intercourse, and we did recite this Verse and understood and memorized it. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did carry out the punishment of stoning and so did we after him. I am afraid that after a long time has passed, somebody will say, 'By Allah, we do not find the Verse of the Rajam in Allah's Book,' and thus they will go astray by leaving an obligation which Allah has revealed. And the punishment of the Rajam is to be inflicted to any married person (male & female), who commits illegal sexual intercourse, if the required evidence is available or there is conception or confession. And then we used to recite among the Verses in Allah's Book: 'O people! Do not claim to be the offspring of other than your fathers, as it is disbelief (unthankfulness) on your part that you claim to be the offspring of other than your real father.' Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Do not praise me excessively as Jesus, son of Marry was praised, but call me Allah's Slave and His Apostles.' (O people!) I have been informed that a speaker amongst you says, 'By Allah, if `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ should die, I will give the pledge of allegiance to such-and-such person.' One should not deceive oneself by saying that the pledge of allegiance given to Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ was given suddenly and it was successful. No doubt, it was like that, but Allah saved (the people) from its evil, and there is none among you who has the qualities of Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ . Remember that whoever gives the pledge of allegiance to anybody among you without consulting the other Muslims, neither that person, nor the person to whom the pledge of allegiance was given, are to be supported, lest they both should be killed. And no doubt after the death of the Prophet (ﷺ) we were informed that the Ansar disagreed with us and gathered in the shed of Bani Sa`da. `Ali and Zubair and whoever was with them, opposed us, while the emigrants gathered with Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ . I said to Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ , 'Let's go to these Ansari brothers of ours.' So we set out seeking them, and when we approached them, two pious men of theirs met us and informed us of the final decision of the Ansar, and said, 'O group of Muhajirin (emigrants) ! Where are you going?' We replied, 'We are going to these Ansari brothers of ours.' They said to us, 'You shouldn't go near them. Carry out whatever we have already decided.' I said, 'By Allah, we will go to them.' And so we proceeded until we reached them at the shed of Bani Sa`da. Behold! There was a man sitting amongst them and wrapped in something. I asked, 'Who is that man?' They said, 'He is Sa`d bin 'Ubada.' I asked, 'What is wrong with him?' They said, 'He is sick.' After we sat for a while, the Ansar's speaker said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah,' and praising Allah as He deserved, he added, 'To proceed, we are Allah's Ansar (helpers) and the majority of the Muslim army, while you, the emigrants, are a small group and some people among you came with the intention of preventing us from practicing this matter (of caliphate) and depriving us of it.' When the speaker had finished, I intended to speak as I had prepared a speech which I liked and which I wanted to deliver in the presence of Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ , and I used to avoid provoking him. So, when I wanted to speak, Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, 'Wait a while.' I disliked to make him angry. So Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ himself gave a speech, and he was wiser and more patient than I. By Allah, he never missed a sentence that I liked in my own prepared speech, but he said the like of it or better than it spontaneously. After a pause he said, 'O Ansar! You deserve all (the qualities that you have attributed to yourselves, but this question (of Caliphate) is only for the Quraish as they are the best of the Arabs as regards descent and home, and I am pleased to suggest that you choose either of these two men, so take the oath of allegiance to either of them as you wish. And then Abu Bakr held my hand and Abu Ubaida bin al-Jarrah's hand who was sitting amongst us. I hated nothing of what he had said except that proposal, for by Allah, I would rather have my neck chopped off as expiator for a sin than become the ruler of a nation, one of whose members is Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ , unless at the time of my death my own-self suggests something I don't feel at present.' And then one of the Ansar said, 'I am the pillar on which the camel with a skin disease (eczema) rubs itself to satisfy the itching (i.e., I am a noble), and I am as a high class palm tree! O Quraish. There should be one ruler from us and one from you.' Then there was a hue and cry among the gathering and their voices rose so that I was afraid there might be great disagreement, so I said, 'O Abu Bakr! Hold your hand out.' He held his hand out and I pledged allegiance to him, and then all the emigrants gave the Pledge of allegiance and so did the Ansar afterwards. And so we became victorious over Sa`d bin Ubada (whom Al-Ansar wanted to make a ruler). One of the Ansar said, 'You have killed Sa`d bin Ubada.' I replied, 'Allah has killed Sa`d bin Ubada.' `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ added, ""By Allah, apart from the great tragedy that had happened to us (i.e. the death of the Prophet), there was no greater problem than the allegiance pledged to Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ because we were afraid that if we left the people, they might give the Pledge of allegiance after us to one of their men, in which case we would have given them our consent for something against our real wish, or would have opposed them and caused great trouble. So if any person gives the Pledge of allegiance to somebody (to become a Caliph) without consulting the other Muslims, then the one he has selected should not be granted allegiance, lest both of them should be killed.""",Al-Maharbeen,Sahih Bukhari,8,Sahih
"6831, 6832",Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:,"I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) ordering that an unmarried person guilty of illegal sexual intercourse be flogged one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year.`Umar bin Al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ also exiled such a person, and this tradition is still valid.",Al-Maharbeen,Sahih Bukhari,8,Sahih
6833,Narrated Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) judged that the unmarried person who was guilty of illegal sexual intercourse be exiled for one year and receive the legal punishment (i.e., be flogged with one-hundred stripes) .",Al-Maharbeen,Sahih Bukhari,8,Sahih
6834,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) cursed the effeminate men and those women who assume the similitude (manners) of men. He also said, ""Turn them out of your houses."" He turned such-and-such person out, and `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ also turned out such-and-such person.",Al-Maharbeen,Sahih Bukhari,8,Sahih
"6835, 6836",Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid رضی اللہ عنہما :,"A bedouin came to the Prophet (ﷺ) while he (the Prophet) was sitting, and said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Give your verdict according to Allah's Laws (in our case)."" Then his opponent got up and said, ""He has told the truth, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Decide his case according to Allah's Laws. My son was a laborer working for this person, and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, and the people told me that my son should be stoned to death, but I offered one-hundred sheep and a slave girl as a ransom for him. Then I asked the religious learned people, and they told me that my son should be flogged with one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge you according to Allah's Laws. The sheep and the slave girl will be returned to you and your son will be flogged one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year. And you, O Unais! Go to the wife of this man (and if she confesses), stone her to death."" So Unais went in the morning and stoned her to death (after she had confessed).",Al-Maharbeen,Sahih Bukhari,8,Sahih
"6837, 6838",Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid رضی اللہ عنہما :,"The verdict of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was sought about an unmarried slave girl guilty of illegal intercourse. He replied, ""If she commits illegal sexual intercourse, then flog her (fifty stripes), and if she commits illegal sexual intercourse (after that for the second time), then flog her (fifty stripes), and if she commits illegal sexual intercourse (for the third time), then flog her (fifty stripes) and sell her for even a hair rope."" Ibn Shihab said, ""I am not sure whether the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered that she be sold after the third or fourth time of committing illegal intercourse.""",Al-Maharbeen,Sahih Bukhari,8,Sahih
6839,Narrated Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""If a lady slave commits illegal sexual intercourse and she is proved guilty of illegal sexual intercourse, then she should be flogged (fifty stripes) but she should not be admonished; and if she commits illegal sexual intercourse again, then she should be flogged again but should not be admonished; and if she commits illegal sexual intercourse for the third time, then she should be sold even for a hair rope."" Hadrat Abu Hurairah رضی اللہ عنہ has also reported from the propet ﷺ likewise.",Al-Maharbeen,Sahih Bukhari,8,Sahih
6840,Narrated Ash-Shaibani:,"I asked `Abdullah bin Abi `Aufa رضی اللہ عنہ about the Rajam (stoning somebody to death for committing illegal sexual intercourse). He replied, ""The Prophet (ﷺ) carried out the penalty of Rajam,"" I asked, ""Was that before or after the revelation of Surat-an-Nur?"" He replied, ""I do not know."" Similarly, Obaidah bin Humaid has has reported it from Shibani. Some people mentioned chapter Al-Maidah but the first is more authentic.",Al-Maharbeen,Sahih Bukhari,8,Sahih
6841,Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما :,"The jews came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and mentioned to him that a man and a lady among them had committed illegal sexual intercourse. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to them, ""What do you find in the Torah regarding the Rajam?"" They replied, ""We only disgrace and flog them with stripes."" `Abdullah bin Salam رضی اللہ عنہ said to them, 'You have told a lie the penalty of Rajam is in the Torah.' They brought the Torah and opened it. One of them put his hand over the verse of the Rajam and read what was before and after it. `Abdullah bin Salam رضی اللہ عنہ said to him, ""Lift up your hand."" Where he lifted it there appeared the verse of the Rajam. So they said, ""O Muhammad! He has said the truth, the verse of the Rajam is in it (Torah)."" Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered that the two persons (guilty of illegal sexual intercourse) be stoned to death, and so they were stoned, and I saw the man bending over the woman so as to protect her from the stones.",Al-Maharbeen,Sahih Bukhari,8,Sahih
"6842, 6843",Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid رضی اللہ عنہما :,"Two men had a dispute in the presence of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). One of them said, ""Judge us according to Allah's Laws."" The other who was more wise said, ""Yes, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), judge us according to Allah's Laws and allow me to speak (first)."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, ""Speak."" He said, ""My son was a laborer for this man, and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, and the people told me that my son should be stoned to death, but I have given one-hundred sheep and a slave girl as a ransom (expiation) for my son's sin.

6844,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ came to me while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was sleeping with his head on my thigh. Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said (to me), ""You have detained Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and the people, and there is no water in this place.""

6845,Narrated Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ came to towards me and struck me violently with his fist and said, ""You have detained the people because of your necklace.""

When the people refused to give up Al-Wisal, the Prophet (ﷺ) fasted along with them for one day, and did not break his fast but continued his fast for another day, and when they saw the crescent, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""If the crescent had not appeared, I would have made you continue your fast (for a third day),"" as if he wanted to punish them for they had refused to give up Al-Wisal.

6854,Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d رضی اللہ عنہ :,"I witnessed the case of Lian (the case of a man who charged his wife for committing illegal sexual intercourse when I was fifteen years old. The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered that they be divorced, and the husband said, ""If I kept her, I would be a liar."" I remember that Az-Zubair also said, ""(It was said) that if that woman brought forth the child with such-and-such description, her husband would prove truthful, but if she brought it with such-and-such description looking like a Wahra (a red insect), he would prove untruthful."" I heard Az-Zubair also saying, ""Finally she gave birth to a child of description which her husband disliked .",Al-Maharbeen,Sahih Bukhari,8,Sahih
6855,Narrated Al-Qasim bin Muhammad:,"Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما mentioned the couple who had taken the oath of Lian. `Abdullah bin Shaddad رضی اللہ عنہما said (to him), ""Was this woman about whom Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'If I were ever to stone to death any woman without witnesses.

The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""O Allah! Reveal the truth."" Later on the lady delivered a child resembling the man whom the husband had accused of having been with her. So the Prophet (ﷺ) made them take the oath of Lian. A man said to Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما in the gathering, ""Was that the same lady about whom the Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""If I were to stone any lady (for committing illegal sexual intercourse) to death without witnesses, I would have stoned that lade to death?""
