4090,Narrated Anas bin Malik رضی اللہ عنہ :,"(The tribes of) Ril, Dhakwan, 'Usaiya and Bani Lihyan asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to provide them with some men to support them against their enemy. He therefore provided them with seventy men from the Ansar whom we used to call Al-Qurra' in their lifetime. They used to collect wood by daytime and pray at night. When they were at the well of Ma'una, the infidels killed them by betraying them. When this news reached the Prophet (ﷺ) , he said Al-Qunut for one month In the morning prayer, invoking evil upon some of the 'Arab tribes, upon Ril, Dhakwan, 'Usaiya and Bani Libyan. We used to read a verse of the Qur'an revealed in their connection, but later the verse was cancelled. It was: ""convey to our people on our behalf the information that we have met our Lord, and He is pleased with us, and has made us pleased."" (Anas bin Malik رضی اللہ عنہ added:) Allah's Prophet said Qunut for one month in the morning prayer, invoking evil upon some of the 'Arab tribes (namely), Ril, Dhakwan, Usaiya, and Bani Libyan. (Anas رضی اللہ عنہ added:) Those seventy Ansari men were killed at the well of Mauna.",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4091,Narrated Anas رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) sent his uncle, the brother of Um Sulaim at the head of seventy riders. The chief of the pagans, 'Amir bin at-Tufail proposed three suggestions (to the Prophet (ﷺ) ) saying, ""Choose one of three alternatives: (1) that the bedouins will be under your command and the townspeople will be under my command; (2) or that I will be your successor, (3) or otherwise I will attack you with two thousand from Bani Ghatafan."" But 'Amir was infected with plague in the House of Um so-and-so. He said, ""Shall I stay in the house of a lady from the family of so-and-so after having a (swelled) gland like that she-camel? Get me my horse."" So he died on the back of his horse. Then Haram, the brother of Um Sulaim and a lame man along with another man from so-and-so (tribe) went towards the pagans (i.e. the tribe of 'Amir). Haram said (to his companions), ""Stay near to me, for I will go to them. If they (i.e. infidels) should give me protection, you will be near to me, and if they should kill me, then you should go back to your companions. Then Haram went to them and said, ""Will you give me protection so as to convey the message of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ?"" So, he started talking to them' but they signalled to a man (to kill him) and he went behind him and stabbed him (with a spear). He (i.e. Haram) said, ""Allahu Akbar! I have succeeded, by the Lord of the Ka`ba!"" The companion of Haram was pursued by the infidels, and then they (i.e. Haram's companions) were all killed except the lame man who was at the top of a mountain. Then Allah revealed to us a verse that was among the cancelled ones later on. It was: 'We have met our Lord and He is pleased with us and has made us pleased.' (After this event) the Prophet (ﷺ) invoked evil on the infidels every morning for 30 days. He invoked evil upon the (tribes of) Ril, Dhakwan, Bani Lihyan and Usaiya who disobeyed Allah and His Apostle.",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4092,Narrated Anas bin Malik رضی اللہ عنہ :,"When Haram bin Milhan, his uncle was stabbed on the day of Bir Ma'una he sprinkled his blood over his face and his head this way and then said, ""I have succeeded, by the Lord of the Ka`ba.'",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4093,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"Abu Bak رضی اللہ عنہ asked the Prophet (ﷺ) to allow him to go out (of Mecca) when he was greatly annoyed (by the infidels). But the Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, ''Wait."" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Do you hope that you will be allowed (to migrate)?"" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, ""I hope so."" So Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ waited for him till one day Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came at noon time and addressed him saying ""Let whoever is present with you, now leave you."" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""None is present but my two daughters."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Have you noticed that I have been allowed to go out (to migrate)?"" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""O Allah's Apostle, I would like to accompany you."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""You will accompany me."" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have got two she-camels which I had prepared and kept ready for (our) going out."" So he gave one of the two (she-camels) to the Prophet (ﷺ) and it was Al-Jad`a . They both rode and proceeded till they reached the Cave at the mountain of Thaur where they hid themselves. Amir bin Fuhaira was the slave of `Abdullah bin at-Tufail bin Sakhbara `Aisha's brother from her mother's side. Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ had a milch she-camel. Amir used to go with it (i.e. the milch she-camel) in the afternoon and come back to them before noon by setting out towards them in the early morning when it was still dark and then he would take it to the pasture so that none of the shepherds would be aware of his job. When the Prophet (and Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ) went away (from the Cave), he (i.e. 'Amir) too went along with them and they both used to make him ride at the back of their camels in turns till they reached Medina. 'Amir bin Fuhaira was martyred on the day of Bir Ma'una. Narrated `Urwa: When those (Muslims) at Bir Ma'una were martyred and `Amr bin Umaiya Ad- Damri رضی اللہ عنہ was taken prisoner, 'Amir bin at-Tufail, pointing at a killed person, asked `Amr, ""Who is this?"" `Amr bin Umaiya رضی اللہ عنہ said to him, ""He is 'Amir bin Fuhaira رضی اللہ عنہ ."" 'Amir bin at-Tufail رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I saw him lifted to the sky after he was killed till I saw the sky between him and the earth, and then he was brought down upon the earth. Then the news of the killed Muslims reached the Prophet (ﷺ) and he announced the news of their death saying, ""Your companions (of Bir Ma'una) have been killed, and they have asked their Lord saying, 'O our Lord! Inform our brothers about us as we are pleased with You and You are pleased with us."" So Allah informed them (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions) about them (i.e. martyrs of Bir Mauna). On that day, `Urwa bin Asma bin As-Salt رضی اللہ عنہ who was one of them, was killed, and `Urwa (bin Az- Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ) was named after `Urwa bin Asma and Mundhir (bin Az Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ) was named after Mundhir bin `Amr رضی اللہ عنہ (who had also been martyred on that day).",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4094,Narrated Anas رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) said Al-Qunut after Bowing (i.e. Ar-Ruku') for one month, invoking evil upon (the tribes of) Ril and Dhakwan.

4095,Narrated Anas bin Malik رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) invoked evil upon those (people) who killed his companions at Bir Mauna for 30 days (in the morning prayer). He invoked evil upon (tribes of) Ril, Lihyan and Usaiya who disobeyed Allah and His Apostle. Allah revealed a Qur'anic Verse to His Prophet regarding those who had been killed, i.e. the Muslims killed at Bir Ma'una, and we recited the Verse till later it was cancelled. (The Verse was:) 'Inform our people that we have met our Lord, and He is pleased with us, and we are pleased with Him.""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4096,Narrated `Asim Al-Ahwal:,"I asked Anas bin Malik رضی اللہ عنہ regarding Al-Qunut during the prayer. Anas رضی اللہ عنہ replied, ""Yes (Al-Qunut was said by the Prophet (ﷺ) in the prayer)."" I said, ""Is it before Bowing or after Bowing?"" Anas replied, ""(It was said) before (Bowing)."" I said, ""So-and-so informed me that you told him that it was said after Bowing."" Anas replied, ""He was mistaken, for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said Al-Qunut after Bowing for one month. The Prophet (ﷺ) had sent some people called Al-Qurra who were seventy in number, to some pagan people who had concluded a peace treaty with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . But those who had concluded the treaty with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) violated the treaty (and martyred all the seventy men). So Allah's Apostle said Al-Qunut after Bowing (in the prayer) for one month, invoking evil upon them.",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

There is no life except the life of the Hereafter, so please forgive the Emigrants and the Ansar.""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4099,Narrated Anas رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went out towards the Khandaq (i.e. Trench) and saw the Emigrants and the Ansar digging the trench in the cold morning. They had no slaves to do that (work) for them. When the Prophet saw their hardship and hunger, he said, 'O Allah! The real life is the life of the Hereafter, so please forgive Ansar and the Emigrants."" They said in reply to him, ""We are those who have given the Pledge of allegiances to Muhammad for to observe Jihad as long as we live.""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

The Prophet (ﷺ) said in reply to their saying, ""O Allah! There is no goodness except the goodness of the Hereafter; so please grant Your Blessing to the Ansar and the Emigrants."" The people used to bring a handful of barley, and a meal used to be prepared thereof by cooking it with a cooking material (i.e. oil, fat and butter having a change in color and smell) and it used to be presented to the people (i.e. workers) who were hungry, and it used to stick to their throats and had a nasty smell.",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4101,Narrated Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ :,"We were digging (the trench) on the day of (Al-Khandaq ( i.e. Trench )) and we came across a big solid rock. We went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, ""Here is a rock appearing across the trench."" He said, ""I am coming down."" Then he got up, and a stone was tied to his belly for we had not eaten anything for three days. So the Prophet (ﷺ) took the spade and struck the big solid rock and it became like sand. I said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allow me to go home."" (When the Prophet (ﷺ) allowed me) I said to my wife, ""I saw the Prophet (ﷺ) in a state that I cannot treat lightly. Have you got something (for him to eat?"" She replied, ""I have barley and a she goat."" So I slaughtered the she-kid and she ground the barley; then we put the meat in the earthenware cooking pot. Then I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) when the dough had become soft and fermented and (the meat in) the pot over the stone trivet had nearly been well-cooked, and said, ""I have got a little food prepared, so get up O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), you and one or two men along with you (for the food)."" The Prophet (ﷺ) asked, ""How much is that food?"" I told him about it. He said, ""It is abundant and good. Tell your wife not to remove the earthenware pot from the fire and not to take out any bread from the oven till I reach there."" Then he said (to all his companions), ""Get up."" So the Muhajirn (i.e. Emigrants) and the Ansar got up. When I came to my wife, I said, ""Allah's Mercy be upon you! The Prophet came along with the Muhajirin and the Ansar and those who were present with them."" She said, ""Did the Prophet (ﷺ) ask you (how much food you had)?"" I replied, ""Yes."" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Enter and do not throng."" The Prophet (ﷺ) started cutting the bread (into pieces) and put the cooked meat over it. He covered the earthenware pot and the oven whenever he took something out of them. He would give the food to his companions and take the meat out of the pot. He went on cutting the bread and scooping the meat (for his companions) till they all ate their fill, and even then, some food remained. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said (to my wife), ""Eat and present to others as the people are struck with hunger.""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4102,Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہما :,"When the Trench was dug, I saw the Prophet (ﷺ) in the state of severe hunger. So I returned to my wife and said, ""Have you got anything (to eat), for I have seen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in a state of severe hunger."" She brought out for me, a bag containing one Sa of barley, and we had a domestic she animal (i.e. a kid) which I slaughtered then, and my wife ground the barley and she finished at the time I finished my job (i.e. slaughtering the kid). Then I cut the meat into pieces and put it in an earthenware (cooking) pot, and returned to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . My wife said, ""Do not disgrace me in front of Allah's Apostle and those who are with him."" So I went to him and said to him secretly, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have slaughtered a she-animal (i.e. kid) of ours, and we have ground a Sa of barley which was with us. So please come, you and another person along with you."" The Prophet (ﷺ) raised his voice and said, ""O people of Trench ! Jabir has prepared a meal so let us go."" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to me, ""Don't put down your earthenware meat pot (from the fireplace) or bake your dough till I come."" So I came (to my house) and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) too, came, proceeding before the people. When I came to my wife, she said, ""May Allah do so-and-so to you."" I said, ""I have told the Prophet (ﷺ) of what you said."" Then she brought out to him (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) the dough, and he spat in it and invoked for Allah's Blessings in it. Then he proceeded towards our earthenware meat-pot and spat in it and invoked for Allah's Blessings in it. Then he said (to my wife). Call a lady-baker to bake along with you and keep on taking out scoops from your earthenware meat-pot, and do not put it down from its fireplace."" They were onethousand (who took their meals), and by Allah they all ate, and when they left the food and went away, our earthenware pot was still bubbling (full of meat) as if it had not decreased, and our dough was still being baked as if nothing had been taken from it.",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
