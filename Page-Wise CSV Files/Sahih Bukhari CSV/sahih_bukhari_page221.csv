Then the chief of that tribe was bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and he was given all sorts of treatment, but all in vain. Some of them said, ""Will you go to the group (those travelers) who have dismounted near you and see if one of them has something useful?"" They came to them and said, ""O the group! Our leader has been bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and we have treated him with everything but nothing benefited him Has anyone of you anything useful?"" One of them replied, ""Yes, by Allah, I know how to treat with a Ruqya. But. by Allah, we wanted you to receive us as your guests but you refused. I will not treat your patient with a Ruqya till you fix for us something as wages."" Consequently they agreed to give those travellers a flock of sheep. The man went with them (the people of the tribe) and started spitting (on the bite) and reciting Surat-al-Fatiha till the patient was healed and started walking as if he had not been sick. When the tribe people paid them their wages they had agreed upon, some of them (the Prophet's companions) said, ""Distribute (the sheep)."" But the one who treated with the Ruqya said, ""Do not do that till we go to Allah's Apostle and mention to him what has happened, and see what he will order us."" So they came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and mentioned the story to him and he said, ""How do you know that Surat-al-Fatiha is a Ruqya? You have done the right thing. Divide (what you have got) and assign for me a share with you.""",Medicine,Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih
