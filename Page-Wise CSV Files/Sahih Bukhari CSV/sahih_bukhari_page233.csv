When this state of affairs was prolonged on Ibn Az-Zubair (he felt it hard on him), he said to Al- Miswar bin Makhrama and `Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin 'Abu Yaghuth, who were from the tribe of Bani Zahra, ""I beseech you, by Allah, to let me enter upon `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا , for it is unlawful for her to vow to cut the relation with me.""

They said (to her), ""The Prophet (ﷺ) forbade what you know of deserting (not speaking to your Muslim Brethren), for it is unlawful for any Muslim not to talk to his brother for more than three nights (days)."" So when they increased their reminding her (of the superiority of having good relation with Kith and kin, and of excusing others' sins), and brought her down to a critical situation, she started reminding them, and wept, saying, ""I have made a vow, and (the question of) vow is a difficult one."" They (Al-Miswar and `Abdur-Rahman) persisted in their appeal till she spoke with `Abdullah bin Az- Zubair رضی اللہ عنہما and she manumitted forty slaves as an expiation for her vow.
