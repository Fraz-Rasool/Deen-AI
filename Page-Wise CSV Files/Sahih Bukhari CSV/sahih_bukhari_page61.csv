1564,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"The people (of the Pre-Islamic Period) used to think that to perform `Umra during the months of Hajj was one of the major sins on earth. And also used to consider the month of Safar as a forbidden (i.e. sacred) month and they used to say, ""When the wounds of the camel's back heal up (after they return from Hajj) and the signs of those wounds vanish and the month of Safar passes away then (at that time) `Umra is permissible for the one who wishes to perform it."" In the morning of the 4th of Dhul- Hijja, the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions reached Mecca, assuming Ihram for Hajj and he ordered his companions to make their intentions of the Ihram for `Umra only (instead of Hajj) so they considered his order as something great and were puzzled, and said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What kind (of finishing) of Ihram is allowed?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, ""Finish the Ihram completely like a non-Muhrim (you are allowed everything).""",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1565,Narrated Abu Musa رضی اللہ عنہ :,I came to the Prophet (from Yemen and was assuming Ihram for Hajj) and he ordered me to finish the Ihram (after performing the `Umra).,Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1566,Narrated Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما :,"Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Why have the people finished their Ihram after performing `Umra but you have not finished your Ihram after performing `Umra?"" He replied, ""I have matted my hair and garlanded my Hadi. So I will not finish my Ihram till I have slaughtered (my Hadi). """,Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1567,Narrated Abu Jamra Nasr bin `Imran Ad-Duba'i:,"""I intended to perform Hajj-at-Tamattu` and the people advised me not to do so. I asked Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما regarding it and he ordered me to perform Hajj-at- Tammatu'. Later I saw in a dream someone saying to me, 'Hajj-Mabrur (Hajj performed in accordance with the Prophet's tradition without committing sins and accepted by Allah) and an accepted `Umra.' So I told that dream to Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما . He said, 'This is the tradition of Abul-Qasim.' Then he said to me, 'Stay with me and I shall give you a portion of my property.' "" I (Shu`ba) asked, ""Why (did he invite you)?"" He (Abu Jamra) said, ""Because of the dream which I had seen.""",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1568,Narrated Abu Shihab:,"I left for Mecca for Hajj-at-Tamattu` assuming Ihram for `Umra. I reached Mecca three days before the day of Tarwiya (8th Dhul-Hijja). Some people of Mecca said to me, ""Your Hajj will be like the Hajj performed by the people of Mecca (i.e. you will lose the superiority of assuming Ihram from the Miqat). So I went to `Ata' asking him his view about it. He said, ""Jabir bin `Abdullah narrated to me, 'I performed Hajj with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on the day when he drove camels with him. The people had assumed Ihram for Hajj-al-Ifrad. The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered them to finish their Ihram after Tawaf round the Ka`ba, and between Safa and Marwa and to cut short their hair and then to stay there (in Mecca) as non-Muhrims till the day of Tarwiya (i.e. 8th of Dhul-Hijja) when they would assume Ihram for Hajj and they were ordered to make the Ihram with which they had come as for `Umra only. They asked, 'How can we make it `Umra (Tamattu`) as we have intended to perform Hajj?' The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'Do what I have ordered you. Had I not brought the Hadi with me, I would have done the same, but I cannot finish my Ihram till the Hadi reaches its destination (i.e. is slaughtered).' So, they did (what he ordered them to do)."" Imam Abu Abdullah Bukhari said: Abu shihab does not have any Musnad Hadith expect for this one.",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1569,Narrated Sa`id bin Al-Musaiyab:,"`Ali and `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہما differed regarding Hajj-at-Tamattu` while they were at 'Usfan (a familiar place near Mecca). `Ali رضی اللہ عنہما said, ""I see you want to forbid people to do a thing that the Prophet (ﷺ) did?"" When `Ali saw that, he assumed Ihram for both Hajj and `Umra.",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1570,Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہما :,We came with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (to Mecca) and we were saying: 'Labbaika Allahumma Labbaik' for Hajj. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered us to perform `Umra with that Ihram (instead of Hajj).,Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1571,Narrated `Imran:,We performed Hajj-at-Tamattu` in the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and then the Qur'an was revealed (regarding Hajj-at-Tamattu`) and somebody said what he wished (regarding Hajj-at-Tamattu`) according his own opinion.,Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1572,Hadrat Ikrimah reports that Hadrat Ibn-e-Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما was asked about Hajj-e-t,"Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما said that he has been asked regarding Hajj-at-Tamattu' on which he said, ""The Muhajirin and the Ansar and the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) and we did the same. When we reached Makkah, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""Give up your intention of doing the Hajj (at this moment) and perform 'Umra, except the one who had garlanded the Hady."" So, we performed Tawaf round the Ka'bah and [Sa'y] between As-safa and Al-MArwa, slept with our wives and wore ordinary (stitched) clothes. The Prophet (ﷺ) added, ""Whoever has garlanded his Hady is not allowed to finish the Ihram till the Hady has reached its destination (has been sacrificed)"". Then on the night of Tarwiya (8th Dhul Hijjah, in the afternoon) he ordered us to assume Ihram for Hajj and when we have performed all the ceremonies of Hajj, we came and performed Tawaf round the Ka'bah and (Sa'y) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa, and then our Hajj was complete, and we had to sacrifice a Hady according to the statement of Allah: ""... He must slaughter a Hady such as he can afford, but if he cannot afford it, he should observer Saum (fasts) three days during the Hajj and seven days after his return (to his home)…."" (V. 2:196). And the sacrifice of the sheep is sufficient. So, the Prophet (ﷺ) and his Companions honied the two religious deeds, (i.e. Hajj and 'Umra) in one year, for Allah revealed (the permissibility) of such practice in His book and in the Sunna (legal ways) of His Prophet (ﷺ) and rendered it permissible for all the people except those living in Makkah. Allah says: ""This is for him whose family is not present at the Al-Masjid-Al-Haram, (i.e. non resident of Makkah)."" The months of Hajj which Allah mentioned in His book are: Shawwal, Dhul-Qa'da and Dhul-Hijjah. Whoever performed Hajj-at-Tamattu' in those months, then slaughtering or fasting is compulsory for him. The words: 1. Ar-Rafatha means sexual intercourse. 2. Al-Fasuq means all kinds of sin, and 3. Al-Jidal means to dispute.",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1573,Narrated Nafi`:,"On reaching the sanctuary of Mecca, Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما used to stop, reciting Talbiya and then he would pass the night at Dhi-Tuwa and then offer the Fajr prayer and take a bath.

1574,Narrated Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما :,"""The Prophet (ﷺ) passed the night at Dhi-Tuwa till it was dawn and then he entered Mecca."" Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما used to do the same.",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih

1579,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"In the year of the conquest of Mecca, the Prophet (ﷺ) entered Mecca from Kada' at the higher place of Mecca. (Hisham, a sub-narrator said, "" `Urwa used to enter (Mecca) from both Kada' and Kuda and he often entered through Kada' which was nearer to his dwelling place.)""",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1580,Narrated `Urwa:,"""The Prophet (ﷺ) entered Mecca in the year of the conquest of Mecca from the side of Kada' which is at the higher part of Mecca."" `Urwa often entered from Kada' which was nearer of the two to his dwelling place.",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1581,Narrated Hisham from his father:,"In the year of the conquest of Mecca, the Prophet (ﷺ) entered Mecca from the side of Kada. `Urwa used to enter through both places and he often entered through Kada' which was nearer of the two to his dwelling place. Imam Abu Abdullah Bukhari said: Kada and Kuda both are places.",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1582,Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہما :,"When the Ka`ba was built, the Prophet (ﷺ) and `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ went to bring stones (for its construction). Al `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ said to the Prophet, ""Take off your waist sheet and put it on your neck."" (When the Prophet (ﷺ) took it off) he fell on the ground with his eyes open towards the sky and said, ""Give me my waist sheet."" And he covered himself with it.",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1583,Narrated `Aisha (the wife of the Prophet):,"""Do you know that when your people (Quraish) rebuilt the Ka`ba, they decreased it from its original foundation laid by Abraham?"" I said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Why don't you rebuild it on its original foundation laid by Abraham?"" He replied, ""Were it not for the fact that your people are close to the Pre-Islamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have recently become Muslims) I would have done so."" The sub-narrator, `Abdullah (bin `Umar ) stated: `Aisha 'must have heard this from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) for in my opinion Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had not placed his hand over the two corners of the Ka`ba opposite Al-Hijr only because the Ka`ba was not rebuilt on its original foundations laid by Abraham. Hadrat Abdullah said: If Hadrat Aishah رضی اللہ عنہا heard from Allah Apostle (ﷺ) then I think this is the reason that Allah Apostle abandoned to kiss (touch with respect) these both pillars which are closed to the Black stone for Allah's House was not lifted up on the foundations laid by Hadrat Ibrahim.",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1584,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"I asked the Prophet (ﷺ) whether the round wall (near Ka`ba) was part of the Ka`ba. The Prophet (ﷺ) replied in the affirmative. I further said, ""What is wrong with them, why have they not included it in the building of the Ka`ba?"" He said, ""Don't you see that your people (Quraish) ran short of money (so they could not include it inside the building of Ka`ba)?"" I asked, ""What about its gate? Why is it so high?"" He replied, ""Your people did this so as to admit into it whomever they liked and prevent whomever they liked. Were your people not close to the Pre-Islamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have recently embraced Islam) and were I not afraid that they would dislike it, surely I would have included the (area of the) wall inside the building of the Ka`ba and I would have lowered its gate to the level of the ground.""",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1585,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to me, ""Were your people not close to the Pre-Islamic period of ignorance, I would have demolished the Ka`ba and would have rebuilt it on its original foundations laid by Abraham (for Quraish had curtailed its building), and I would have built a back door (too)."" Moaviyah reported from Hisham that خَلْفًا means a door.",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1586,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) said to her, ""O Aisha! Were your nation not close to the Pre-Islamic Period of Ignorance, I would have had the Ka`ba demolished and would have included in it the portion which had been left, and would have made it at a level with the ground and would have made two doors for it, one towards the east and the other towards the west, and then by doing this it would have been built on the foundations laid by Abraham."" That was what urged Ibn-Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہما to demolish the Ka`ba. Yazeed said, ""I saw Ibn-Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہما when he demolished and rebuilt the Ka`ba and included in it a portion of Al-Hijr (the unroofed portion of Ka`ba which is at present in the form of a compound towards the northwest of the Ka`ba). I saw the original foundations of Abraham which were of stones resembling the humps of camels."" So Jarir asked Yazid, ""Where was the place of those stones?"" Jazz said, ""I will just now show it to you."" So Jarir accompanied Yazid and entered Al-Hijr, and he pointed to a place and said, ""Here it is."" Jarir said, ""It appeared to me about six cubits from Al-Hijr or so.""",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1587,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"On the Day of the Conquest of Mecca, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""Allah has made this town a sanctuary. Its thorny bushes should not be cut, its game should not be chased, and its fallen things should not be picked up except by one who would announce it publicly.""",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1588,Narrated 'Usama bin Zaid رضی اللہ عنہما :,"I asked, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Where will you stay in Mecca? Will you stay in your house in Mecca?"" He replied, ""Has `Aqil left any property or house?"" `Aqil along with Talib had inherited the property of Abu Talib. Jafar and `Ali رضی اللہ عنہما did not inherit anything as they were Muslims and the other two were non-believers. `Umar bin Al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ used to say, ""A believer cannot inherit (anything from an) infidel."" Ibn Shihab, (a sub-narrator) said, ""They (`Umar and others) derived the above verdict from Allah's Statement: ""Verily! those who believed and Emigrated and strove with their life And property in Allah's Cause, And those who helped (the emigrants) And gave them their places to live in, These are (all) allies to one another.""
