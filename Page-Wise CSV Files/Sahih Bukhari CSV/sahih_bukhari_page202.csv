5258,Narrated Abi Ghallib Yunus bin Jubair:,"I asked Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما ,""(What is said regarding) a man divorces his wife during her period?"" He said, ""Do you know Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما ? Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما divorced his wife while she was menstruating. `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ then went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and mentioned that to him. The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered him to take her back and when she became clean, he could divorce her if he wanted."" I asked (Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما ), ""Was that divorce counted as one legal divorce?"" He said, ""If one becomes helpless and foolish (will he be excused? Of course not). """,Divorce,Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih
5259,Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d As-Sa`idi رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Uwaimir Al-`Ajlani رضی اللہ عنہ came to `Asim bin Adi Al-Ansari رضی اللہ عنہ and asked, ""O `Asim! Tell me, if a man sees his wife with another man, should he kill him, whereupon you would kill him in Qisas, or what should he do? O `Asim! Please ask Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about that."" `Asim رضی اللہ عنہ asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about that. Allah's Apostle disliked that question and considered it disgraceful. What `Asim رضی اللہ عنہ heard from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was hard on him. When he returned to his family, 'Uwaimir came to him and said ""O `Asim! What did Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) say to you?"" `Asim رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""You never bring me any good. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) disliked to hear the problem which I asked him about."" 'Uwaimir said, ""By Allah, I will not leave the matter till I ask him about it."" So 'Uwaimir proceeded till he came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who was in the midst of the people and said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! If a man finds with his wife another man, should he kill him, whereupon you would kill him (in Qisas): or otherwise, what should he do?"" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""Allah has revealed something concerning the question of you and your wife. Go and bring her here."" So they both carried out the judgment of Lian, while I was present among the people (as a witness). When both of them had finished, 'Uwaimir رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! If I should now keep my wife with me, then I have told a lie"". Then he pronounced his decision to divorce her thrice before Allah's Apostle ordered him to do so. (Ibn Shihab said, ""That was the tradition for all those who are involved in a case of Lian.""",Divorce,Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih
5260,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"The wife of Rifa`a Al-Qurazi رضی اللہ عنہا came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Rifa`a divorced me irrevocably. After him I married `Abdur-Rahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi رضی اللہ عنہا who proved to be impotent."" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to her, ""Perhaps you want to return to Rifa`a? Nay (you cannot return to Rifa`a) until you and `Abdur-Rahman consummate your marriage.""",Divorce,Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih
5261,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"A man divorced his wife thrice (by expressing his decision to divorce her thrice), then she married another man who also divorced her.

The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, ""No, she cannot marry the first husband unless the second husband consummates his marriage with her, just as the first husband had done.""",Divorce,Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih
5262,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave us the option (to remain with him or to be divorced) and we selected Allah and His Apostle . So, giving us that option was not regarded as divorce.",Divorce,Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih

My first husband divorced me and then I married another man who entered upon me to consummate his marriage but he proved to be impotent and did not approach me except once during which he benefited nothing from me.

5267,Narrated `Ubaid bin `Umar:,"I heard `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا saying, ""The Prophet (ﷺ) used to stay for a long while with Zanab bint Jahsh رضی اللہ عنہا and drink honey at her house. So Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہ and I decided that if the Prophet (ﷺ) came to anyone of us, she should say him, ""I detect the smell of Maghafir (a nasty smelling gum) in you. Have you eaten Maghafir?' "" So the Prophet (ﷺ) visited one of them and she said to him similarly. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Never mind, I have taken some honey at the house of Zainab bint Jahsh رضی اللہ عنہا, but I shall never drink of it anymore."" So there was revealed: 'O Prophet ! Why do you ban (for you) that which Allah has made lawful for you . . . If you two (wives of Prophet) turn in repentance to Allah,' (66.1-4) addressing Aisha and Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہما . 'When the Prophet (ﷺ) disclosed a matter in confidence to some of his wives.' (66.3) namely his saying: But I have taken some honey.""",Divorce,Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih
5268,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was fond of honey and sweet edible things and (it was his habit) that after finishing the `Asr prayer he would visit his wives and stay with one of them at that time. Once he went to Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا , the daughter of `Umar and stayed with her more than usual. I got jealous and asked the reason for that. I was told that a lady of her folk had given her a skin filled with honey as a present, and that she made a syrup from it and gave it to the Prophet (ﷺ) to drink (and that was the reason for the delay). I said, ""By Allah we will play a trick on him (to prevent him from doing so)."" So I said to Sa`da bint Zam`a رضی اللہ عنہا ""The Prophet (ﷺ) will approach you, and when he comes near you, say: 'Have you taken Maghafir (a bad-smelling gum)?' He will say, 'No.' Then say to him: 'Then what is this bad smell which i smell from you?' He will say to you, 'Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا made me drink honey syrup.' Then say: Perhaps the bees of that honey had sucked the juice of the tree of Al-`Urfut.' I shall also say the same. O you, Safiyya, say the same."" Later Sa`da رضی اللہ عنہا said, ""By Allah, as soon as he (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) stood at the door, I was about to say to him what you had ordered me to say because I was afraid of you."" So when the Prophet (ﷺ) came near Sa`da رضی اللہ عنہا , she said to him, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Have you taken Maghafir?"" He said, ""No."" She said. ""Then what is this bad smell which I detect on you?"" He said, ""Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا made me drink honey syrup."" She said, ""Perhaps its bees had sucked the juice of Al-`Urfut tree."" When he came to me, I also said the same, and when he went to Safiyya, she also said the same. And when the Prophet (ﷺ) again went to Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا , she said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Shall I give you more of that drink?"" He said, ""I am not in need of it."" Sa`da رضی اللہ عنہا said, ""By Allah, we deprived him (of it)."" I said to her, ""Keep quiet.""
