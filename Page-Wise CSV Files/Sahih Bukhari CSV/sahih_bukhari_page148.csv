3855,Narrated `AbdurRahman bin Abza رضی اللہ عنہ :,"""Ask Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما about these two Qur'anic Verses: 'Nor kill such life as Allah has made sacred, Except for just cause.' (25.168) ""And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell. (4.93) So I asked Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما who said, ""When the Verse that is in Sura-al-Furqan was revealed, the pagans of Mecca said, 'But we have slain such life as Allah has made sacred, and we have invoked other gods along with Allah, and we have also committed fornication.' So Allah revealed:-- 'Except those who repent, believe, and do good-- (25.70) So this Verse was concerned with those people. As for the Verse in Surat-an-Nisa (4-93), it means that if a man, after understanding Islam and its laws and obligations, murders somebody, then his punishment is to dwell in the (Hell) Fire forever."" Then I mentioned this to Mujahid who said, ""Except the one who regrets (one's crime) . """,Merits of the Helpers in Madinah (Ansaar),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

"" Ibn-e-Ishaq also reported the same.

3860,Narrated Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ :,"That once he was in the company of the Prophet (ﷺ) carrying a water pot for his ablution and for cleaning his private parts. While he was following him carrying it (i.e. the pot), the Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Who is this?"" He said, ""I am Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ ."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Bring me stones in order to clean my private parts, and do not bring any bones or animal dung."" Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ went on narrating: So I brought some stones, carrying them in the corner of my robe till I put them by his side and went away. When he finished, I walked with him and asked, ""What about the bone and the animal dung?"" He said, ""They are of the food of Jinns. The delegate of Jinns of (the city of) Nasibin came to me--and how nice those Jinns were--and asked me for the remains of the human food. I invoked Allah for them that they would never pass by a bone or animal dung but find food on them.""",Merits of the Helpers in Madinah (Ansaar),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
3861,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"When Abu Dhar رضی اللہ عنہ received the news of the Advent of the Prophet (ﷺ) he said to his brother, ""Ride to this valley (of Mecca) and try to find out the truth of the person who claims to be a prophet who is informed of the news of Heaven. Listen to what he says and come back to me."" So his brother set out and came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and listened to some of his talks, and returned to Abu Dhar رضی اللہ عنہ and said to him. ""I have seen him enjoining virtuous behavior and saying something that is not poetry."" Abu Dhar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""You have not satisfied me as to what I wanted."" He then took his journey-food and carried a water skin of his, containing some water till be reached Mecca. He went to the Mosque and searched for the Prophet and though he did not know him, he hated to ask anybody about him. When a part of the night had passed away, `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ saw him and knew that he was a stranger. So when Abu Dhar رضی اللہ عنہ saw `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ , he followed him, and none of them asked his companion about anything, and when it was dawn, Abu Dhar رضی اللہ عنہ took his journey food and his water-skin to the Mosque and stayed there all the day long without being perceived by the Prophet, and when it was evening, he came back to his retiring place. `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ passed by him and said, ""Has the man not known his dwelling place yet?"" So `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ awakened him and took him with him and none of them spoke to the other about anything. When it was the third day. `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ did the same and Abu Dhar رضی اللہ عنہ stayed with him. Then `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ said ""Will you tell me what has brought you here?"" Abu Dhar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""If you give me a firm promise that you will guide me, then I will tell you."" `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ promised him, and he informed `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ about the matter. `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""It is true, and he is the Messenger of Allah. Next morning when you get up, accompany me, and if I see any danger for you, I will stop as if to pass water, but if I go on, follow me and enter the place which I will enter."" Abu Dhar رضی اللہ عنہ did so, and followed `Ali till he entered the place of the Prophet, and Abu Dhar رضی اللہ عنہ went in with him, Abu Dhar رضی اللہ عنہ listened to some of the Prophet's talks and embraced Islam on the spot. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, ""Go back to your people and inform them (about it) till you receive my order."" Abu Dhar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""By Him in Whose Hand my life is, I will proclaim my conversion loudly amongst them (i.e. the pagans)."" So he went out, and when he reached the Mosque, he said as loudly as possible, ""I bear witness that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah."" The People got up and beat him painfully. Then Al-Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما came and knelt over him ((to protect him) and said (to the people), ""Woe to you! Don't you know that this man belongs to the tribe of Ghifar and your trade to Sha'm is through their way?"" So he rescued him from them. Abu Dhar رضی اللہ عنہ again did the same the next day. They beat him and took vengeance on him and again Al-Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ knelt over him (to protect him).",Merits of the Helpers in Madinah (Ansaar),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

He was from the tribe of Bani Sahm who were our allies during the pre-Islamic period of ignorance. Al-`As said to `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ ""What is wrong with you?"" He said, ""Your people claim that they would kill me if I become a Muslim."" Al-`As said, ""Nobody will harm you after I have given protection to you.""

Call the man to me."" When the man was called to him, he told him of his thought.

He said, ""I was a foreteller in the pre-lslamic period of ignorance."" Then `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Tell me the most astonishing thing your female Jinn has told you of."" He said, ""One-day while I was in the market, she came to me scared and said, 'Haven't you seen the Jinns and their despair and they were overthrown after their defeat (and prevented from listening to the news of the heaven) so that they (stopped going to the sky and) kept following camel-riders (i.e. 'Arabs)?"" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""He is right."" and added, ""One day while I was near their idols, there came a man with a calf and slaughtered it as a sacrifice (for the idols). An (unseen) creature shouted at him, and I have never heard harsher than his voice. He was crying, 'O you bold evil-doer! A matter of success! An eloquent man is saying: None has the right to be worshipped except you (O Allah).' On that the people fled, but I said, 'I shall not go away till I know what is behind this.' Then the cry came again: 'O you bold evil-doer! A matter of success! An eloquent man is saying: None has the right to be worshipped except Allah.'

3872,Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin 'Abu Yaghuth:,"""What prevents you from speaking to your uncle `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ regarding his brother Al-Walid bin `Uqba?"" The people were speaking against the latter for what he had done. 'Ubaidullah said, ""So I kept waiting for `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ , and when he went out for the prayer, I said to him, 'I have got something to say to you as a piece of advice.' `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ said, 'O man! I seek Refuge with Allah from you. So I went away. When I finished my prayer, I sat with Al-Miswar and Ibn 'Abu Yaghutb and talked to both of them of what I had said to `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ and what he had said to me. They said, 'You have done your duty.' So while I was sitting with them. `Uthman's Messenger came to me. They said, 'Allah has put you to trial."" I set out and when I reached `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ , he said, 'What is your advice which you mentioned a while ago?' I recited Tashahhud and added, 'Allah has sent Muhammad and has revealed the Holy Book (i.e. Qur'an) to him. You (O `Uthman!) were amongst those who responded to the call of Allah and His Apostle and had faith in him. And you took part in the first two migrations (to Ethiopia and to Medina), and you enjoyed the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and learned his traditions and advice. Now the people are talking much about Al-Walid bin `Uqba and so it is your duty to impose on him the legal punishment.' `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ then said to me, 'O my nephew! Did you ever meet Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ?' I said, 'No, but his knowledge has reached me as it has reached the virgin in her seclusion.' `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ then recited Tashahhud and said, 'No doubt, Allah has sent Muhammad with the Truth and has revealed to him His Holy Book (i.e. Qur'an) and I was amongst those who responded to the call of Allah and His Apostle and I had faith in Muhammad's Mission, and I had performed the first two migrations as you have said, and I enjoyed the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and gave the pledge of allegiance to him. By Allah, I never disobeyed him and never cheated him till Allah caused him to die. Then Allah made Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ Caliph, and by Allah, I was never disobedient to him, nor did I cheat him. Then `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ became Caliph, and by Allah, I was never disobedient to him, nor did I cheat him. Then I became Caliph. Have I not then the same rights over you as they had over me?' I replied in the affirmative. `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ further said, 'The what are these talks which are reaching me from you? As for what you ha mentioned about Al-Walid bin 'Uqb; Allah willing, I shall give him the leg; punishment justly. Then `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ ordered that Al-Walid be flogged fort lashes.
