6207,Narrated Usama bin Zaid رضی اللہ عنہما :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) rode over a donkey covered with a Fadakiya (velvet sheet) and Usama was riding behind him. He was visiting Sa`d bin 'Ubada رضی اللہ عنہ (who was sick) in the dwelling place of Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj and this incident happened before the battle of Badr. They proceeded till they passed by a gathering in which `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present., and that was before `Abdullah bin Ubat embraced Islam. In that gathering there were Muslims, pagan idolators and Jews, and among the Muslims there was `Abdullah bin Rawaha رضی اللہ عنہ . When a cloud of dust raised by (the movement of ) the animal covered that gathering, `Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his garment and said, ""Do not cover us with dust."" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) greeted them, stopped, dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e. to embrace Islam) and recited to them the Holy Qur'an. On that `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul said to him, ""O man! There is nothing better than what you say, if it is the truth. So do not trouble us with it in our gatherings, but if somebody comes to you, you can preach to him."" On that `Abdullah bin Rawaha said ""Yes, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Call on us in our gathering, for we love that."" So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing one another till they were about to fight with one another. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept on quietening them till all of them became quiet, and then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) rode his animal and proceeded till he entered upon Sa`d bin 'Ubada. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""O Sa`d! Didn't you hear what Abu Habab said?"" (meaning `Abdullah bin Unbar). ""He said so-and-so."" Sa`d bin Ubada said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Let my father be sacrificed for you ! Excuse and forgive him for, by Him Who revealed to you the Book, Allah sent the Truth which was revealed to you at the time when the people of this town had decided to crown him (`Abdullah bin Ubai) as their ruler. So when Allah had prevented that with the Truth He had given you, he was choked by that, and that caused him to behave in such an impolite manner which you had noticed."" So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) excused him. (It was the custom of) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his companions to excuse the pagans and the people of the scripture (Christians and Jews) as Allah ordered them, and they used to be patient when annoyed (by them). Allah said: 'You shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you.....and from the pagans (3.186) He also said: 'Many of the people of the scripture wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed. .... (2.109) So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to apply what Allah had ordered him by excusing them till he was allowed to fight against them. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had fought the battle of Badr and Allah killed whomever He killed among the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of Quraish, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his companions had returned with victory and booty, bringing with them some of the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of the Quraish as captives. `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul and the pagan idolators who were with him, said, ""This matter (Islam) has now brought out its face (triumphed), so give Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) the pledge of allegiance (for embracing Islam.)"". Then they became Muslims.",Good Manners and Form (Al-Adab),Sahih Bukhari,8,Sahih
