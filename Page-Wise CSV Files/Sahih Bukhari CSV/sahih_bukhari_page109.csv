Can the good bring about evil?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) remained silent and we thought that he was being inspired divinely, so all the people kept silent with awe. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) wiped the sweat off his face and asked, ""Where is the present questioner?"" ""Do you think wealth is good?"" he repeated thrice, adding, ""No doubt, good produces nothing but good.

This worldly property is sweet vegetation. How excellent the wealth of the Muslim is, if it is collected through legal means and is spent in Allah's Cause and on orphans, poor people and travelers.
