5309,Narrated Ibn Juraij:,"Ibn Shihab informed me of Lian and the tradition related to it, referring to the narration of Sahl bin Sa`d رضی اللہ عنہ , the brother of Bani Sa`idi He said, ""An Ansari man came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, 'O Allah's Apostle! If a man saw another man with his wife, should he kill him, or what should he do?' So Allah revealed concerning his affair what is mentioned in the Holy Qur'an about the affair of those involved in a case of Lian. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'Allah has given His verdict regarding you and your wife.' So they carried out Lian in the mosque while I was present there. When they had finished, the man said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! If I should now keep her with me as a wife then I have told a lie about her. Then he divorced her thrice before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered him, when they had finished the Lian process. So he divorced her in front of the Prophet (ﷺ) ."" Ibn Shihab added, ""After their case, it became a tradition that a couple involved in a case of Lian should be separated by divorce. That lady was pregnant then, and later on her son was called by his mother's name. The tradition concerning their inheritance was that she would be his heir and he would inherit of her property the share Allah had prescribed for him."" Ibn Shihab said that Sahl bin Sa`d As'Saidi رضی اللہ عنہ said that the Prophet (ﷺ) said (in the above narration), ""If that lady delivers a small red child like a lizard, then the lady has spoken the truth and the man was a liar, but if she delivers a child with black eyes and huge lips, then her husband has spoken the truth.""

5310,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"""Once Lian was mentioned before the Prophet (ﷺ) whereupon `Asim bin Adi رضی اللہ عنہ said something and went away.

The man was pale, thin, and of lank hair, while the other man whom he claimed he had seen with his wife, was brown, fat and had much flesh on his calves. The Prophet (ﷺ) invoked, saying, 'O Allah! Reveal the truth.' So that lady delivered a child resembling the man whom her husband had mentioned he had found her with. The Prophet (ﷺ) then made them carry out Lian.""
