4476,Narrated Anas رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""On the Day of Resurrection the Believers will assemble and say, 'Let us ask somebody to intercede for us with our Lord.' So they will go to Adam and say, 'You are the father of all the people, and Allah created you with His Own Hands, and ordered the angels to prostrate to you, and taught you the names of all things; so please intercede for us with your Lord, so that He may relieve us from this place of ours.' Adam will say, 'I am not fit for this (i.e. intercession for you).' Then Adam will remember his sin and feel ashamed thereof. He will say, 'Go to Noah, for he was the first Apostle, Allah sent to the inhabitants of the earth.' They will go to him and Noah will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking.' He will remember his appeal to his Lord to do what he had no knowledge of, then he will feel ashamed thereof and will say, 'Go to the Khalil--r-Rahman (i.e. Abraham).' They will go to him and he will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking. Go to Moses, the slave to whom Allah spoke (directly) and gave him the Torah .' So they will go to him and he will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking.' and he will mention (his) killing a person who was not a killer, and so he will feel ashamed thereof before his Lord, and he will say, 'Go to Jesus, Allah's Slave, His Apostle and Allah's Word and a Spirit coming from Him. Jesus will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking, go to Muhammad the Slave of Allah whose past and future sins were forgiven by Allah.' So they will come to me and I will proceed till I will ask my Lord's Permission and I will be given permission. When I see my Lord, I will fall down in Prostration and He will let me remain in that state as long as He wishes and then I will be addressed.' (Muhammad!) Raise your head. Ask, and your request will be granted; say, and your saying will be listened to; intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.' I will raise my head and praise Allah with a saying (i.e. invocation) He will teach me, and then I will intercede. He will fix a limit for me (to intercede for) whom I will admit into Paradise. Then I will come back again to Allah, and when I see my Lord, the same thing will happen to me. And then I will intercede and Allah will fix a limit for me to intercede whom I will let into Paradise, then I will come back for the third time; and then I will come back for the fourth time, and will say, 'None remains in Hell but those whom the Qur'an has imprisoned (in Hell) and who have been destined to an eternal stay in Hell.' "" (The compiler) Abu `Abdullah said: 'But those whom the Qur'an has imprisoned in Hell,' refers to the Statement of Allah: ""They will dwell therein forever.""

What is the first meal of the people of Paradise? And what makes a baby look like its father or mother?'. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Just now Gabriel has informed me about that."" `Abdullah said, ""Gabriel?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Yes."" `Abdullah said, ""He, among the angels is the enemy of the Jews."" On that the Prophet (ﷺ) recited this Holy Verse:-- ""Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel (let him die in his fury!) for he has brought it (i.e. Qur'an) down to your heart by Allah's permission."" (2.97) Then he added, ""As for the first portent of the Hour, it will be a fire that will collect the people from the East to West. And as for the first meal of the people of Paradise, it will be the caudite (i.e. extra) lobe of the fish liver. And if a man's discharge proceeded that of the woman, then the child resembles the father, and if the woman's discharge proceeded that of the man, then the child resembles the mother."" On hearing that, `Abdullah said, ""I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that you are the Messenger of Allah, O, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ); the Jews are liars, and if they should come to know that I have embraced Islam, they would accuse me of being a liar."" In the meantime some Jews came (to the Prophet) and he asked them, ""What is `Abdullah's status amongst you?"" They replied, ""He is the best amongst us, and he is our chief and the son of our chief."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""What would you think if `Abdullah bin Salam embraced Islam?"" They replied, ""May Allah protect him from this!"" Then `Abdullah came out and said, ""I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah."" The Jews then said, ""Abdullah is the worst of us and the son of the worst of us,"" and disparaged him. On that `Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! This is what I was afraid of!""",Prophetic Commentary on the Qur'an (Tafseer of the Prophet (PBUH)),Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih

4482,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Allah said, 'The son of Adam tells a lie against me though he has no right to do so, and he abuses Me though he has no right to do so.

Glorified be Me! I am far from taking a wife or offspring.' """,Prophetic Commentary on the Qur'an (Tafseer of the Prophet (PBUH)),Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih
4483,Narrated Anas رضی اللہ عنہ :,"`Umarرضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I agreed with Allah in three things,"" or said, ""My Lord agreed with me in three things. I said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Would that you took the station of Abraham as a place of prayer.' I also said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Good and bad persons visit you! Would that you ordered the Mothers of the believers to cover themselves with veils.' So the Divine Verses of Al-Hijab (i.e. veiling of the women) were revealed. I came to know that the Prophet (ﷺ) had blamed some of his wives so I entered upon them and said, 'You should either stop (troubling the Prophet (ﷺ) ) or else Allah will give His Apostle better wives than you.' When I came to one of his wives, she said to me, 'O `Umar! Does Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) haven't what he could advise his wives with, that you try to advise them?' "" Thereupon Allah revealed:-- ""It may be, if he divorced you (all) his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you Muslims (who submit to Allah)..""

The sub-narrator, `Abdullah bin `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما said, ""Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا had surely heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying that, for I do not think that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) left touching the two corners of the Ka`ba facing Al-Hijr except because the Ka`ba was not built on all Abraham's foundations.""",Prophetic Commentary on the Qur'an (Tafseer of the Prophet (PBUH)),Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih
