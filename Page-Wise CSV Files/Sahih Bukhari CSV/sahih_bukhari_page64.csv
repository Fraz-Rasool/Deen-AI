1643,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"""How do you interpret the statement of Allah,. : Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah, and whoever performs the Hajj to the Ka`ba or performs `Umra, it is not harmful for him to perform Tawaf between them (Safa and Marwa.) (2.158). By Allah! (it is evident from this revelation) there is no harm if one does not perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa."" `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا said, ""O, my nephew! Your interpretation is not true. Had this interpretation of yours been correct, the statement of Allah should have been, 'It is not harmful for him if he does not perform Tawaf between them.' But in fact, this divine inspiration was revealed concerning the Ansar who used to assume lhram for worship ping an idol called ""Manat"" which they used to worship at a place called Al-Mushallal before they embraced Islam, and whoever assumed Ihram (for the idol), would consider it not right to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. When they embraced Islam, they asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) regarding it, saying, ""O Allah's Apostle! We used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa."" So Allah revealed: 'Verily; (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.' "" Aisha added, ""Surely, Allah's Apostle set the tradition of Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, so nobody is allowed to omit the Tawaf between them."" Later on I (`Urwa) told Abu Bakr bin `Abdur-Rahman (of `Aisha's narration) and he said, 'I have not heard of such information, but I heard learned men saying that all the people, except those whom `Aisha mentioned and who used to assume lhram for the sake of Manat, used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. When Allah referred to the Tawaf of the Ka`ba and did not mention Safa and Marwa in the Qur'an, the people asked, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa and Allah has revealed (the verses concerning) Tawaf of the Ka`ba and has not mentioned Safa and Marwa. Is there any harm if we perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?' So Allah revealed: ""Verily As-Safa and Al- Marwa are among the symbols of Allah."" Abu Bakr said, ""It seems that this verse was revealed concerning the two groups, those who used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa in the Pre- Islamic Period of ignorance and those who used to perform the Tawaf then, and after embracing Islam they refrained from the Tawaf between them as Allah had enjoined Tawaf of the Ka`ba and did not mention Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) till later after mentioning the Tawaf of the Ka`ba.'",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1644,Narrated Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما :,"""When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) performed the first Tawaf he did Ramal in the first three rounds and then walked in the remaining four rounds (of Tawaf of the Ka`ba), where as in performing Tawaf between Safa and Marwa he used to run in the midst of the rainwater passage,"" I asked Nafi`, ""Did `Abdullah (bin `Umar) رضی اللہ عنہما use to walk steadily on reaching the Yemenite Corner?"" He replied, ""No, unless people were crowded at the Corner; otherwise he would not leave it without touching it.""",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
"1645, 1646",Narrated `Amr bin Dinar:,"We asked Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما whether a man who, while performing `Umra, had performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba; and had not yet performed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, could have sexual relation with his wife, Ibn `Umar replied ""The Prophet (ﷺ) reached Mecca and performed the seven rounds (of Tawaf) of the Ka`ba and then offered a two-rak`at prayer behind Maqam Ibrahim and then performed the seven rounds (of Tawaf) between Safa and Marwa."" He added, ""Verily! In Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) you have a good example."" "" We asked Jabir bin `Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہما (the same question) and he said, ""He (that man) should not come near (his wife) till he has completed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.""",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1647,Narrated `Amr bin Dinar:,"I heard Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما saying, ""The Prophet (ﷺ) arrived at Mecca and performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba and then offered a two-rak`at prayer and then performed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa."" Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما then recited (the verse): ""Verily! In Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) you have a good example. """,Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1648,Narrated `Asim:,"I asked Anas bin Malik: ""Did you use to dislike to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?"" He said, ""Yes, as it was of the ceremonies of the days of the Pre-Islamic period of ignorance, till Allah revealed: 'Verily! (The two mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah. It is therefore no sin for him who performs the pilgrimage to the Ka`ba, or performs `Umra, to perform Tawaf between them.' "" (2.158)",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1649,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba and the Sa`i of Safa and Marwa so as to show his strength to the pagans. Humaidi has added a little bit more and Sufyan, Amr, Ataa reported from Hadrat Ibn-e-Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما according to that (Hadith).",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1650,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"I was menstruating when I reached Mecca. So, I neither performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba, nor the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. Then I informed Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about it. He replied, ""Perform all the ceremonies of Hajj like the other pilgrims, but do not perform Tawaf of the Ka`ba till you get clean (from your menses).""",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1651,Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہما :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions assumed Ihram for Hajj and none except the Prophet (ﷺ) and Talha had the Hadi (sacrifice) with them. `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ arrived from Yemen and had a Hadi with him. `Ali said, ""I have assumed Ihram for what the Prophet (ﷺ) has done."" The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered his companions to perform the `Umra with the lhram which they had assumed, and after finishing Tawaf (of Ka`ba, Safa and Marwa) to cut short their hair, and to finish their lhram except those who had Hadi with them. They (the people) said, ""How can we proceed to Mina (for Hajj) after having sexual relations with our wives?"" When that news reached the Prophet (ﷺ) he said, ""If I had formerly known what I came to know lately, I would not have brought the Hadi with me. Had there been no Hadi with me, I would have finished the state of lhram."" `Aisha got her menses, so she performed all the ceremonies of Hajj except Tawaf of the Ka`ba, and when she got clean (from her menses), she performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba. She said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! (All of you) are returning with the Hajj and `Umra, but I am returning after performing Hajj only."" So the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered `Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to accompany her to Tan`im and thus she performed the `Umra after the Hajj.",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1652,Narrated Hafsa:,"(On `Id) We used to forbid our virgins to go out (for `Id prayer). A lady came and stayed at the Palace of Bani Khalaf. She mentioned that her sister was married to one of the companions of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who participated in twelve Ghazawats along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and her sister was with him in six of them. She said, ""We used to dress the wounded and look after the patients."" She (her sister) asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) , ""Is there any harm for a woman to stay at home if she doesn't have a veil?"" He said, ""She should cover herself with the veil of her companion and she should take part in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers."" When Um 'Atiyya رضی اللہ عنہا came, I asked her. ""Did you hear anything about that?"" Um 'Atiyya رضی اللہ عنہا said, ""Bi Abi"" and she never mentioned the name of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) without saying ""Bi Abi"" (i.e. 'Let my father be sacrificed for you'). We asked her, ""Have you heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying so and so (about women)?"" She replied in the affirmative and said, ""Let my father be sacrificed for him. He told us that unmarried mature virgins who stay often screened or unmarried young virgins and mature girls who stay often screened should come out and take part in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers. But the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla (praying place)."" I asked her, ""The menstruating women?""

1655,Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar ر ضی اللہ عنہما :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) offered a two-rak`at prayer at Mina. Abu Bakr, `Umar and `Uthman ر ضی اللہ عنہما , (during the early years of his caliphate) followed the same practice.",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih

1660,Narrated S`Abdul Malik wrote to Al-Hajjaj:,"He should not differ from Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما during Hajj.

Al-Hajjaj came Out, wrapping himself with a waist-sheet dyed with safflower, and said, ""O Abu `Abdur-Rahman! What is the matter?""
