4230,Narrated Abu Musa رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The news of the migration of the Prophet (from Mecca to Medina) reached us while we were in Yemen. So we set out as emigrants towards him. We were (three) I and my two brothers. I was the youngest of them, and one of the two was Abu Burda رضی اللہ عنہ , and the other, Abu Ruhm, and our total number was either 53 or 52 men from my people. We got on board a boat and our boat took us to Negus in Ethiopia. There we met Ja`far bin Abi Talib رضی اللہ عنہ and stayed with him. Then we all came (to Medina) and met the Prophet (ﷺ) at the time of the conquest of Khaibar. Some of the people used to say to us, namely the people of the ship, ""We have migrated before you."" Asma' bint 'Umais رضی اللہ عنہا who was one of those who had come with us, came as a visitor to Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا , the wife the Prophet (ﷺ) .

Asma' replied, ""Yes."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""We have migrated before you (people of the boat), so we have got more right than you over Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) "" On that Asma' became angry and said, ""No, by Allah, while you were with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who was feeding the hungry ones amongst you, and advised the ignorant ones amongst you, we were in the far-off hated land of Ethiopia, and all that was for the sake of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . By Allah, I will neither eat any food nor drink anything till I inform Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) of all that you have said. There we were harmed and frightened. I will mention this to the Prophet (ﷺ) and will not tell a lie or curtail your saying or add something to it.""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

While the slave was dismounting the saddle of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) an arrow the thrower of which was unknown, came and hit him. The people said, ""Congratulations to him for the martyrdom."" Allah's Apostle said, ""No, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the sheet (of cloth) which he had taken (illegally) on the day of Khaibar from the booty before the distribution of the booty, has become a flame of Fire burning him.""

"4240, 4241",Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"Fatima رضی اللہ عنہا the daughter of the Prophet (ﷺ) sent someone to Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ (when he was a caliph), asking for her inheritance of what Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had left of the property bestowed on him by Allah from the Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting) in Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus of the Khaibar booty. On that, Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Our property is not inherited. Whatever we leave, is Sadaqa, but the family of (the Prophet) Muhammad can eat of this property.' By Allah, I will not make any change in the state of the Sadaqa of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and will leave it as it was during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and will dispose of it as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to do."" So Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ refused to give anything of that to Fatima رضی اللہ عنہا . So she became angry with Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ and kept away from him, and did not task to him till she died. She remained alive for six months after the death of the Prophet. When she died, her husband `Ali, buried her at night without informing Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ and he said the funeral prayer by himself. When Fatima رضی اللہ عنہا was alive, the people used to respect `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ much, but after her death, `Ali noticed a change in the people's attitude towards him. So `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ sought reconciliation with Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ and gave him an oath of allegiance. `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ had not given the oath of allegiance during those months (i.e. the period between the Prophet's death and Fatima's death). `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ sent someone to Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ saying, ""Come to us, but let nobody come with you,"" as he disliked that `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ should come, `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said (to Abu Bakr), ""No, by Allah, you shall not enter upon them alone."" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""What do you think they will do to me? By Allah, I will go to them"". So Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ entered upon them, and then `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ uttered Tashah-hud and said (to Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ), ""We know well your superiority and what Allah has given you, and we are not jealous of the good what Allah has bestowed upon you, but you did not consult us in the question of the rule and we thought that we have got a right in it because of our near relationship to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ."" Thereupon Abu Bakr's eyes flowed with tears. And when Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ spoke, he said, ""By Him in Whose Hand my soul is to keep good relations with the relatives of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is dearer to me than to keep good relations with my own relatives. But as for the trouble which arose between me and you about his property, I will do my best to spend it according to what is good, and will not leave any rule or regulation which I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) following, in disposing of it, but I will follow."" On that `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ said to Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ , ""I promise to give you the oath of allegiance in this after noon."" So when Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ had offered the Zuhr prayer, he ascended the pulpit and uttered the Tashah-hud and then mentioned the story of `Ali and his failure to give the oath of allegiance, and excused him, accepting what excuses he had offered; Then `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ (got up) and praying (to Allah) for forgiveness, he uttered Tashah-hud, praised Abu Bakr's right, and said, that he had not done what he had done because of jealousy of Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ or as a protest of that Allah had favored him with. `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ added, ""But we used to consider that we too had some right in this affair (of rulership) and that he (i.e. Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ) did not consult us in this matter, and therefore caused us to feel sorry."" On that all the Muslims became happy and said, ""You have done the right thing."" The Muslims then became friendly with `Ali as he returned to what the people had done (i.e. giving the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ).",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

On that, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said (to him). ""Are all the dates of Khaibar like this?"" He said, ""No, by Allah, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! But we take one Sa of these (dates of good quality) for two or three Sa's of other dates (of inferior quality)."" On that, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""Do not do so, but first sell the inferior quality dates for money and then with that money, buy Janib.""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
