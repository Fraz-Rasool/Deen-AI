4301,Narrated Abu Jamila رضی اللہ عنہ :,"While we were in the company of the Ibn Al-Musaiyab, Sunain Abi Jamila informed us (a Hadith), Abu Jamila said that he lived during the lifetime of the Prophet (ﷺ) and that he had accompanied him ( to Mecca) during the year of the Conquest (of Mecca).",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4302,Narrated `Abu Qalabah رضی اللہ عنہ :,"We were at a place which was a thoroughfare for the people, and the caravans used to pass by us and we would ask them, ""What is wrong with the people? What is wrong with the people? Who is that man?. They would say, ""That man claims that Allah has sent him (as an Apostle), that he has been divinely inspired, that Allah has revealed to him such-and-such."" I used to memorize that (Divine) Talk, and feel as if it was inculcated in my chest (i.e. mind) And the 'Arabs (other than Quraish) delayed their conversion to Islam till the Conquest (of Mecca). They used to say."" ""Leave him (i.e. Muhammad) and his people Quraish: if he overpowers them then he is a true Prophet. So, when Mecca was conquered, then every tribe rushed to embrace Islam, and my father hurried to embrace Islam before (the other members of) my tribe. When my father returned (from the Prophet) to his tribe, he said, ""By Allah, I have come to you from the Prophet (ﷺ) for sure!"" The Prophet (ﷺ) afterwards said to them, 'Offer such-and-such prayer at such-and-such time, and when the time for the prayer becomes due, then one of you should pronounce the Adhan (for the prayer), and let the one amongst you who knows Qur'an most should, lead the prayer."" So they looked for such a person and found none who knew more Qur'an than I because of the Qur'anic material which I used to learn from the caravans. They therefore made me their Imam ((to lead the prayer) and at that time I was a boy of six or seven years, wearing a Burda (i.e. a black square garment) proved to be very short for me (and my body became partly naked). A lady from the tribe said, ""Won't you cover the anus of your reciter for us?"" So they bought (a piece of cloth) and made a shirt for me. I had never been so happy with anything before as I was with that shirt.",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4303,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"`Utba bin Abi Waqqas authorized his brother Sa`d رضی اللہ عنہ to take the son of the slave-girl of Zam`a into his custody. `Utba said (to him). ""He is my son."" When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) arrived in Mecca during the Conquest (of Mecca), Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas رضی اللہ عنہ took the son of the slave-girl of Zam`a and took him to the Prophet (ﷺ) `Abd bin Zam`a too came along with him. Sa`d رضی اللہ عنہ said. ""This is the son of my brother and the latter has informed me that he is his son."" `Abd bin Zam`a said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! This is my brother who is the son of the slave-girl of Zam`a and was born on his (i.e. Zam'as) bed.' Allah's Apostle looked at the son of the slave-girl of Zam`a and noticed that he, of all the people had the greatest resemblance to `Utba bin Abi Waqqas. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said (to `Abd), "" He is yours; he is your brother, O `Abd bin Zam`a, he was born on the bed (of your father)."" (At the same time) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said (to his wife Sauda), ""Veil yourself before him (i.e. the son of the slave-girl) O Sauda,"" because of the resemblance he noticed between him and `Utba bin Abi Waqqas رضی اللہ عنہ . Allah's Apostle added, ""The boy is for the bed (i.e. for the owner of the bed where he was born), and stone is for the adulterer."" (Ibn Shihab said, ""Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ used to say that (i.e. the last statement of the Prophet in the above Hadith 596, publicly."")",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4304,Narrated `Urwa bin Az-Zubair:,"A lady committed theft during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in the Ghazwa of Al-Fath, ((i.e. Conquest of Mecca). Her folk went to Usama bin Zaid رضی اللہ عنہما to intercede for her (with the Prophet). When Usama رضی اللہ عنہ interceded for her with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), the color of the face of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) changed and he said, ""Do you intercede with me in a matter involving one of the legal punishments prescribed by Allah?"" Usama رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Ask Allah's Forgiveness for me."" So in the afternoon, Allah's Apostle got up and addressed the people. He praised Allah as He deserved and then said, ""Amma ba'du ! The nations prior to you were destroyed because if a noble amongst them stole, they used to excuse him, and if a poor person amongst them stole, they would apply (Allah's) Legal Punishment to him. By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad's soul is, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad stole, I would cut her hand."" Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave his order in the case of that woman and her hand was cut off. Afterwards her repentance proved sincere and she got married. `Aisha said, ""That lady used to visit me and I used to convey her demands to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

I said to the Prophet, ""For what will you take his pledge of allegiance?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""I will take his pledge of allegiance for Islam, Belief, and for Jihad (i.e. fighting in Allah's Cause)"".

So choose one of two alternatives: Either the captives or the properties. I have been waiting for you (i.e. have not distributed the booty)."" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had delayed the distribution of their booty over ten nights after his return from Ta'if. So when they came to know that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was not going to return to them but one of the two, they said, ""We prefer to have our captives."" So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up amongst the Muslims, and praising Allah as He deserved, said, ""To proceed! Your brothers have come to you with repentance and I see (it logical) to return their captives. So, whoever of you likes to do that as a favor then he can do it. And whoever of you likes to stick to his share till we give him from the very first booty which Allah will give us, then he can do so.""

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""We do not know which of you have agreed to it and which have not; so go back and let your chiefs forward us your decision.""

Some people have narrated its chain like this: Hammad from Ayyub, he from Nafii and he from Ibn-e-Umer رضی اللہ عنہما who has reported from the prophet ﷺ.

4321,Narrated Abu Qatada رضی اللہ عنہ :,"We set out along with the Prophet (ﷺ) during the year of (the battle of) Hunain, and when we faced the enemy, the Muslims (with the exception of the Prophet (ﷺ) and some of his companions) retreated (before the enemy). I saw one of the pagans over-powering one of the Muslims, so I struck the pagan from behind his neck causing his armor to be cut off. The pagan headed towards me and pressed me so forcibly that I felt as if I was dying. Then death took him over and he released me. Afterwards I followed `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ and said to him, ""What is wrong with the people?"" He said, ""It is the Order of Allah."" Then the Muslims returned (to the battle after the flight) and (after overcoming the enemy) the Prophet sat and said, ""Whoever had killed an Infidel and has an evidence to this issue, will have the Salb (i.e. the belonging of the deceased e.g. clothes, arms, horse, etc)."" I (stood up) and said, ""Who will be my witness?"" and then sat down. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) repeated his question. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said the same (for the third time). I got up and said, ""Who will be my witness?"" and then sat down. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked his former question again. So I got up. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, What is the matter, O Abu Qatada?"" So I narrated the whole story; A man said, ""Abu Qatada has spoken the truth, and the Salb of the deceased is with me, so please compensate Abu Qatada on my behalf."" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""No! By Allah, it will never happen that the Prophet (ﷺ) will leave a Lion of Allah who fights for the Sake of Allah and His Apostle and give his spoils to you."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ has spoken the truth. Give it (the spoils) back to him (O man)!"" So he gave it to me and I bought a garden in (the land of) Banu Salama with it (i.e. the spoils) and that was the first property I got after embracing Islam.",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4322,Narrated Abu Qatada رضی اللہ عنہ :,"When it was the day of (the battle of) Hunain, I saw a Muslim man fighting with one of the pagans and another pagan was hiding himself behind the Muslim in order to kill him. So I hurried towards the pagan who was hiding behind the Muslim to kill him, and he raised his hand to hit me but I hit his hand and cut it off. That man got hold of me and pressed me so hard that I was afraid (that I would die), then he knelt down and his grip became loose and I pushed him and killed him. The Muslims (excepting the Prophet (ﷺ) and some of his companions) started fleeing and I too, fled with them. Suddenly I met `Umar bin Al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ amongst the people and I asked him, ""What is wrong with the people?"" He said, ""It is the order of Allah"" Then the people returned to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (after defeating the enemy). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""Whoever produces a proof that he has killed an infidel, will have the spoils of the killed man."" So I got up to look for an evidence to prove that I had killed an infidel, but I could not find anyone to bear witness for me, so I sat down. Then it came to my mind (that I should speak of it) and I mentioned the case to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). A man from the persons who were sitting with him (i.e. the Prophet), said, ""The arms of the deceased one whom he ( i.e. Abu Qatada رضی اللہ عنہ) has mentioned, are with me, so please compensate him for it (i.e. the spoils),"" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""No, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) will not give it (i.e. the spoils) to a weak humble person from Quraish and leave one of Allah's Lions who fights on behalf of Allah and His Apostle."" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then got up and gave that (spoils) to me, and I bought with it, a garden which was the first property I got after embracing Islam.",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

The Prophet (ﷺ) sent me with Abu 'Amir. Abu Amir رضی اللہ عنہ was shot at his knee with an arrow which a man from Jushm had shot and fixed into his knee. I went to him and said, ""O Uncle! Who shot you?"" He pointed me out (his killer) saying, ""That is my killer who shot me (with an arrow)."" So I headed towards him and overtook him, and when he saw me, he fled, and I followed him and started saying to him, ""Won't you be ashamed? Won't you stop?"" So that person stopped, and we exchanged two hits with the swords and I killed him. Then I said to Abu 'Amir رضی اللہ عنہ . ""Allah has killed your killer.""

Convey my compliments to the Prophet (ﷺ) and request him to ask Allah's Forgiveness for me."" Abu Amir رضی اللہ عنہ made me his successor in commanding the people (i.e. troops). He survived for a short while and then died.

The strings of the bed had their traces over his back and sides. Then I told the Prophet (ﷺ) about our and Abu Amir's news and how he had said ""Tell him to ask for Allah's Forgiveness for me."" The Prophet (ﷺ) asked for water, performed ablution and then raised hands, saying, ""O Allah's Forgive `Ubaid, Abu Amir رضی اللہ عنہ ."" At that time I saw the whiteness of the Prophet's armpits.
