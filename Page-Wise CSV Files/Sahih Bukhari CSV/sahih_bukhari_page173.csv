4521,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"A man who wants to perform the Hajj (from Mecca) can perform the Tawaf around the Ka`ba as long as he is not in the state of Ihram till he assumes the Ihram for Hajj. Then, if he rides and proceeds to `Arafat, he should take a Hadi (i.e. animal for sacrifice), either a camel or a cow or a sheep, whatever he can afford; but if he cannot afford it, he should fast for three days during the Hajj before the day of `Arafat, but if the third day of his fasting happens to be the day of `Arafat (i.e. 9th of Dhul-Hijja) then it is no sin for him (to fast on it). Then he should proceed to `Arafat and stay there from the time of the `Asr prayer till darkness falls. Then the pilgrims should proceed from `Arafat, and when they have departed from it, they reach Jam' (i.e. Al-Muzdalifa) where they ask Allah to help them to be righteous and dutiful to Him, and there they remember Allah greatly or say Takbir (i.e. Allah is Greater) and Tahlil (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah) repeatedly before dawn breaks. Then, after offering the morning (Fajr) prayer you should pass on (to Mina) for the people used to do so and Allah said:-- ""Then depart from the place whence all the people depart. And ask for Allah's Forgiveness. Truly! Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."" (2.199) Then you should go on doing so till you throw pebbles over the Jamra.",Prophetic Commentary on the Qur'an (Tafseer of the Prophet (PBUH)),Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih

"4524, 4525",Narrated Ibn Abu Mulaika:,"Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما recited: ""(Respite will be granted) until when the Apostles gave up hope (of their people) and thought that they were denied (by their people). There came to them Our Help ...."" (12.110) reading Kudhibu without doubling the sound 'dh', and that was what he understood of the Verse. Then he went on reciting: ""..even the Apostle and those who believed along with him said: When (will come) Allah's Help? Yes, verily, Allah's Help is near."" (2.214) Then I met `Urwa bin Az-Zubair and I mentioned that to him. He said, ""Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا said, 'Allah forbid! By Allah, Allah never promised His Apostle anything but he knew that it would certainly happen before he died. But trials were continuously presented before the Apostles till they were afraid that their followers would accuse them of telling lies. So I used to recite:-- ""Till they (come to) think that they were treated as liars."" reading 'Kudh-dhibu with double 'dh.'",Prophetic Commentary on the Qur'an (Tafseer of the Prophet (PBUH)),Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih
"4526, 4527",Narrated Nafi`:,"Whenever Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما recited the Qur'an, he would not speak to anyone till he had finished his recitation. Once I held the Qur'an and he recited Surat-al-Baqara from his memory and then stopped at a certain Verse and said, ""Do you know in what connection this Verse was revealed?"" I replied, ""No."" He said, ""It was revealed in such-and-such connection."" Ibn `Umar then resumed his recitation.

4528,Narrated Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Jews used to say: ""If one has sexual intercourse with his wife from the back, then she will deliver a squint-eyed child.""

4529,Narrated Ma'qal bin Yasar رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The sister of Ma'qal bin Yasar رضی اللہ عنہ was divorced by her husband who left her till she had fulfilled her term of 'Iddat (i.e. the period which should elapse before she can Remarry) and then he wanted to remarry her but Maqal رضی اللہ عنہ refused, so this Verse was revealed:-- ""Do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands."" (2.232)",Prophetic Commentary on the Qur'an (Tafseer of the Prophet (PBUH)),Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih
4530,Narrated Ibn Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہما :,"I said to `Uthman bin `Affan (while he was collecting the Qur'an) regarding the Verse:-- ""Those of you who die and leave wives ..."" (2.240) ""This Verse was abrogated by an other Verse. So why should you write it? (Or leave it in the Qur'an)?"" `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ said. ""O son of my brother! I will not shift anything of it from its place.""",Prophetic Commentary on the Qur'an (Tafseer of the Prophet (PBUH)),Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih
4531,Narrated Mujahi:,"(regarding the Verse):-- ""Those of you who die and leave wives behind. They - (their wives) -- shall wait (as regards their marriage ) for four months and ten days)."" (2.234) The widow, according to this Verse, was to spend this period of waiting with her husband's family, so Allah revealed: ""Those of you who die and leave wives (i.e. widows) should bequeath for their wives, a year's maintenance and residences without turning them out, but if they leave (their residence), there is no blame on you for what they do with themselves provided it is honorable.' (i.e. lawful marriage) (2.240). So Allah entitled the widow to be bequeathed extra maintenance for seven months and twenty nights, and that is the completion of one year. If she wished she could stay (in her husband's home) according to the will, and she could leave it if she wished, as Allah says: ""..without turning them out, but if they leave (the residence), there is no blame on you."" So the 'Idda (i.e. four months and ten days as it) is obligatory for her. 'Ata said: Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما said, ""This Verse, i.e. the Statement of Allah: ""..without turning them out.."" cancelled the obligation of staying for the waiting period in her dead husband's house, and she can complete this period wherever she likes."" 'Ata's aid: If she wished, she could complete her 'Idda by staying in her dead husband's residence according to the will or leave it according to Allah's Statement:-- ""There is no blame on you for what they do with themselves."" `Ata' added: Later the regulations of inheritance came and abrogated the order of the dwelling of the widow (in her dead husband's house), so she could complete the 'Idda wherever she likes. And it was no longer necessary to provide her with a residence. Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما said, ""This Verse abrogated her (i.e. widow's) dwelling in her dead husband's house and she could complete the 'Idda (i.e. four months and ten days) wherever she liked, as Allah's Statement says:--""...without turning them out...""",Prophetic Commentary on the Qur'an (Tafseer of the Prophet (PBUH)),Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih
4532,Narrated Muhammad bin Seereen:,"I sat in a gathering in which the chiefs of the Ansar were present, and `Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Laila was amongst them. I mentioned the narration of `Abdullah bin `Utba regarding the question of Subai'a bint Al-Harith. `Abdur-Rahman said, ""But `Abdullah's uncle used not to say so."" I said, ""I am too brave if I tell a lie concerning a person who is now in Al-Kufa,"" and I raised my voice. Then I went out and met Malik bin 'Amir or Malik bin `Auf, and said, ""What was the verdict of Ibn Mas`ud رضی اللہ عنہ about the pregnant widow whose husband had died?"" He replied, ""Ibn Mas`ud رضی اللہ عنہ said, 'Why do you impose on her the hard order and don't let her make use of the leave? The shorter Sura of women (i.e. Surat-at- Talaq) was revealed after the longer Sura (i.e. Surat-al-Baqara)."" (i.e. Her 'Idda is up till she delivers.)

Then we were ordered not to speak in the prayers.",Prophetic Commentary on the Qur'an (Tafseer of the Prophet (PBUH)),Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih
4535,Narrated Nafi`:,"Whenever `Abdullah bin `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما was asked about Salat-al-Khauf (i.e. prayer of fear) he said, ""The Imam comes forward with a group of people and leads them in a one rak`a prayer while another group from them who has not prayed yet, stay between the praying group and the enemy. When those who are with the Imam have finished their one rak`a, they retreat and take the positions of those who have not prayed but they will not finish their prayers with Taslim. Those who have not prayed, come forward to offer a rak`a with the Imam (while the first group covers them from the enemy). Then the Imam, having offered two rak`at, finishes his prayer. Then each member of the two groups offer the second rak`a alone after the Imam has finished his prayer. Thus each one of the two groups will have offered two rak`at. But if the fear is too great, they can pray standing on their feet or riding on their mounts, facing the Qibla or not."" Nafi` added: I do not think that `Abdullah bin `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما narrated this except from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (See Hadith No. 451, Vol 5 to know exactly ""The Fear Prayer."")",Prophetic Commentary on the Qur'an (Tafseer of the Prophet (PBUH)),Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih
