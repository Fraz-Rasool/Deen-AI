4574,Narrated `Urwa bin Az-Zubair:,"He asked `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا regarding the Statement of Allah: ""If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls..."" (4.3) She said, ""O son of my sister! An Orphan girl used to be under the care of a guardian with whom she shared property. Her guardian, being attracted by her wealth and beauty, would intend to marry her without giving her a just Mahr, i.e. the same Mahr as any other person might give her (in case he married her). So such guardians were forbidden to do that unless they did justice to their female wards and gave them the highest Mahr their peers might get. They were ordered (by Allah, to marry women of their choice other than those orphan girls."" `Aisha added,"" The people asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) his instructions after the revelation of this Divine Verse whereupon Allah revealed: ""They ask your instruction regarding women "" (4.127) `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا further said, ""And the Statement of Allah: ""And yet whom you desire to marry."" (4.127) as anyone of you refrains from marrying an orphan girl (under his guardianship) when she is lacking in property and beauty."" `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا added, ""So they were forbidden to marry those orphan girls for whose wealth and beauty they had a desire unless with justice, and that was because they would refrain from marrying them if they were lacking in property and beauty.""",Prophetic Commentary on the Qur'an (Tafseer of the Prophet (PBUH)),Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih
4575,Narrated Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"regarding the Statement of Allah: ""And whoever amongst the guardian is rich, he should take no wages, but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable (according to his work).

4577,Narrated Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ came on foot to pay me a visit (during my illness) at Banu Salama's (dwellings). The Prophet (ﷺ) found me unconscious, so he asked for water and performed the ablution from it and sprinkled some water over it. I came to my senses and said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What do you order me to do as regards my wealth?"" So there was revealed:-- ""Allah commands you as regards your children's (inheritance):"" (4.11)",Prophetic Commentary on the Qur'an (Tafseer of the Prophet (PBUH)),Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih
4578,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"(In the Pre-Islamic Period ) the children used to inherit all the property but the parents used to inherit only through a will. So Allah cancelled that which He liked to cancel and put decreed that the share of a son was to be twice the share of a daughter, and for the parents one-sixth for each one of them, or one third, and for the wife one-eighth or one-fourth, and for the husband one-half, or one-fourth.",Prophetic Commentary on the Qur'an (Tafseer of the Prophet (PBUH)),Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih
4579,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"regarding the Divine Verse: ""O you who believe! You are forbidden to inherit women against their will, and you should not treat them with harshness that you may take back part of the (Mahr) dower you have given them."" (4.19) (Before this revelation) if a man died, his relatives used to have the right to inherit his wife, and one of them could marry her if he would, or they would give her in marriage if they wished, or, if they wished, they would not give her in marriage at all, and they would be more entitled to dispose her, than her own relatives. So the above Verse was revealed in this connection.",Prophetic Commentary on the Qur'an (Tafseer of the Prophet (PBUH)),Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih
4580,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"Regarding the Verse: ""To everyone, We have appointed heirs."" (4.33) 'Mawali' means heirs. And regarding:-- ""And those to whom your right hands have pledged."" When the Emigrants came to Medina, an Emigrant used to be the heir of an Ansari with the exclusion of the latter's relatives, and that was because of the bond of brotherhood which the Prophet (ﷺ) had established between them (i.e. the Emigrants and the Ansar). So when the Verses:-- ""To everyone We have appointed heirs."" was revealed, (the inheritance through bond of brotherhood) was cancelled. Ibn `Abbas then said: ""And those to whom your right hands have pledged."" is concerned with the covenant of helping and advising each other. So allies are no longer to be the heir of each other, but they can bequeath each other some of their property by means of a will. Abu Osamah has heard it from Idrees and he from Hadrat Talha.",Prophetic Commentary on the Qur'an (Tafseer of the Prophet (PBUH)),Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih
4581,Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri رضی اللہ عنہ :,"During the lifetime of the Prophet (ﷺ) some people said, : O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Yes; do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun at midday when it is bright and there is no cloud in the sky?"" They replied, ""No."" He said, ""Do you have any difficulty in seeing the moon on a full moon night when it is bright and there is no cloud in the sky?"" They replied, ""No."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""(Similarly) you will have no difficulty in seeing Allah on the Day of Resurrection as you have no difficulty in seeing either of them. On the Day of Resurrection, a call-maker will announce, ""Let every nation follow that which they used to worship."" Then none of those who used to worship anything other than Allah like idols and other deities but will fall in Hell (Fire), till there will remain none but those who used to worship Allah, both those who were obedient (i.e. good) and those who were disobedient (i.e. bad) and the remaining party of the people of the Scripture. Then the Jews will be called upon and it will be said to them, 'Who do you use to worship?' They will say, 'We used to worship Ezra, the son of Allah.' It will be said to them, 'You are liars, for Allah has never taken anyone as a wife or a son. What do you want now?' They will say, 'O our Lord! We are thirsty, so give us something to drink.' They will be directed and addressed thus, 'Will you drink,' whereupon they will be gathered unto Hell (Fire) which will look like a mirage whose different sides will be destroying each other. Then they will fall into the Fire. Afterwards the Christians will be called upon and it will be said to them, 'Who do you use to worship?' They will say, 'We used to worship Jesus, the son of Allah.' It will be said to them, 'You are liars, for Allah has never taken anyone as a wife or a son,' Then it will be said to them, 'What do you want?' They will say what the former people have said. Then, when there remain (in the gathering) none but those who used to worship Allah (Alone, the real Lord of the Worlds) whether they were obedient or disobedient. Then (Allah) the Lord of the worlds will come to them in a shape nearest to the picture they had in their minds about Him. It will be said, 'What are you waiting for?' Every nation have followed what they used to worship.' They will reply, 'We left the people in the world when we were in great need of them and we did not take them as friends. Now we are waiting for our Lord Whom we used to worship.' Allah will say, 'I am your Lord.' They will say twice or thrice, 'We do not worship any besides Allah.'

4582,Narrated `Abdullah bin Masud رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to me, ""Recite (of the Qur'an) for me,"" I said, ""Shall I recite it to you although it had been revealed to you?"" He said, ""I like to hear (the Qur'an) from others."" So I recited Surat-an- Nisa' till I reached: ""How (will it be) then when We bring from each nation a witness, and We bring you (O Muhammad) as a witness against these people?"" (4.41) Then he said, ""Stop!"" And behold, his eyes were overflowing with tears.""",Prophetic Commentary on the Qur'an (Tafseer of the Prophet (PBUH)),Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih

Irrigate (your lands and the let the water flow to your neighbor The Ansar said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (This is because) he (Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ ) is your cousin?"" At that, the Prophet's face became red (with anger) and he said ""O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and then withhold the water till it fills the land up to the walls and then let it flow to your neighbor."" So the Prophet (ﷺ) enabled Az- Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ to take his full right after the Ansari provoked his anger. The Prophet (ﷺ) had previously given a order that was in favor of both of them Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I don't think but the Verse was revealed in this connection: ""But no, by your Lord, they can have no faith, until they make you judge in all disputes between them.""
