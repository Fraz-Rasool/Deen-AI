Thereof I became as distressed as I have never been before, and stayed at home. Then Allah revealed (Surat Al-Munafiqin): 'When the hypocrites come to you.....(63.1) They are the ones who say: Spend nothing on those who are with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ..(63.7) Verily the more honorable will expel therefrom the meaner..'

He sent for `Abdullah bin Ubai and asked him, but `Abdullah bin Ubai swore that he did not say so. The people said, ""Zaid رضی اللہ عنہ told a lie to 'Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)."" What they said distressed me very much. Later Allah revealed the confirmation of my statement in his saying:-- '(When the hypocrites come to you.'

So, he (who beckoned) got ashamed, but Hadrat Abdur Rehman said: His uncle does not say so. Then I met Abu Atiyyah Malik bin Amir and asked him, and he narrated me the Hadith of Sobaiah. I, thereafter, asked him whether he had heard anything from Hadrat Abdullah (bin Masoud) رضی اللہ عنہ in this regard, he said: We were in the company of Hadrat Abdullah (bin Masoud) رضی اللہ عنہ and he said: Do you put her in difficulty and ignore facility in her matter?

When he went to perform the Hajj, I too went along with him. On our return, while we were still on the way home. `Umar رضی اللہ عنہwent aside to answer the call of nature by the Arak trees. I waited till he finished and then I proceeded with him and asked him. ""O chief of the Believers! Who were the two wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) who aided one another against him?"" He said, ""They were Hafsa and `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہما ."" Then I said to him, ""By Allah, I wanted to ask you about this a year ago, but I could not do so owing to my respect for you."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Do not refrain from asking me. If you think that I have knowledge (about a certain matter), ask me; and if I know (something about it), I will tell you."" Then `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ added, ""By Allah, in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance we did not pay attention to women until Allah revealed regarding them what He revealed regarding them and assigned for them what He has assigned. Once while I was thinking over a certain matter, my wife said, ""I recommend that you do so-and-so."" I said to her, ""What have you got to do with the is matter? Why do you poke your nose in a matter which I want to see fulfilled.?"" She said, How strange you are, O son of Al-Khattab! You don't want to be argued with whereas your daughter, Hafsa surely, argues with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) so much that he remains angry for a full day!"" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ then reported; how he at once put on his outer garment and went to Hafsa and said to her, ""O my daughter! Do you argue with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) so that he remains angry the whole day?""

Don't be betrayed by the one who is proud of her beauty because of the love of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) for her (i.e. `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہما )."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ addled, ""Then I went out to Um Salama's house who was one of my relatives, and I talked to her. She said, O son of Al-Khattab! It is rather astonishing that you interfere in everything; you even want to interfere between Allah's Apostle and his wives!' By Allah, by her talk she influenced me so much that I lost some of my anger. I left her (and went home). At that time I had a friend from the Ansar who used to bring news (from the Prophet) in case of my absence, and I used to bring him the news if he was absent. In those days we were afraid of one of the kings of Ghassan tribe. We heard that he intended to move and attack us, so fear filled our hearts because of that. (One day) my Ansari friend unexpectedly knocked at my door, and said, ""Open Open!' I said, 'Has the king of Ghassan come?' He said, 'No, but something worse; Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has isolated himself from his wives.' I said, 'Let the nose of `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہما and Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا be stuck to dust (i.e. humiliated)!' Then I put on my clothes and went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)'s residence, and behold, he was staying in an upper room of his to which he ascended by a ladder, and a black slave of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was (sitting) on the first step. I said to him, 'Say (to the Prophet (ﷺ) ) `Umar bin Al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ is here.' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) admitted me and I narrated the story to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). When I reached the story of Um Salama رضی اللہ عنہما , Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiled while he was lying on a mat made of palm tree leaves with nothing between him and the mat. Underneath his head there was a leather pillow stuffed with palm fibres, and leaves of a saut tree were piled at his feet, and above his head hung a few water skins. On seeing the marks of the mat imprinted on his side, I wept. He said.' 'Why are you weeping?' I replied, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Caesar and Khosrau are leading the life (i.e. Luxurious life) while you, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) though you are, is living in destitute"". The Prophet (ﷺ) then replied.
