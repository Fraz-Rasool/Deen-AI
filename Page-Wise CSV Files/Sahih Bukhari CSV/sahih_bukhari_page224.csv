Once there was some dispute between me and my wife and she answered me back in a loud voice. I said to her, 'Strange! You can retort in this way?' She said, 'Yes. Do you say this to me while your daughter troubles Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?' So I went to Hafsa and said to her, 'I warn you not to disobey Allah and His Apostle.' I first went to Hafsa and then to Um Salama and told her the same. She said to me, 'O `Umar! It surprises me that you interfere in our affairs so much that you would poke your nose even into the affairs of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his wives.' So she rejected my advice. There was an Ansari man; whenever he was absent from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and I was present there, I used to convey to him what had happened (on that day), and when I was absent and he was present there, he used to convey to me what had happened as regards news from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . During that time all the rulers of the nearby lands had surrendered to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) except the king of Ghassan in Sham, and we were afraid that he might attack us. All of a sudden the Ansari came and said, 'A great event has happened!' I asked him, 'What is it? Has the Ghassani (king) come?' He said, 'Greater than that! Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has divorced his wives! I went to them and found all of them weeping in their dwellings, and the Prophet (ﷺ) had ascended to an upper room of his. At the door of the room there was a slave to whom I went and said, ""Ask the permission for me to enter.""
