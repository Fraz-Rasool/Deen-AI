"1354, 1355",Narrated Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما :,"`Umar رضی اللہ عنہ set out along with the Prophet (ﷺ) with a group of people to Ibn Saiyad till they saw him playing with the boys near the hillocks of Bani Mughala. Ibn Saiyad at that time was nearing his puberty and did not notice (us) until the Prophet (ﷺ) stroked him with his hand and said to him, ""Do you testify that I am Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?"" Ibn Saiyad looked at him and said, ""I testify that you are the Messenger of illiterates."" Then Ibn Saiyad asked the Prophet (ﷺ), ""Do you testify that I am Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) refuted it and said, ""I believe in Allah and His Apostles."" Then he said (to Ibn Saiyad), ""What do you think?"" Ibn Saiyad answered, ""True people and liars visit me."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""You have been confused as to this matter."" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, ""I have kept something (in my mind) for you, (can you tell me that?)"" Ibn Saiyad said, ""It is Al-Dukh (the smoke)."" (2) The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Let you be in ignominy. You cannot cross your limits."" On that `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ , said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allow me to chop his head off."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""If he is he (i.e. Dajjal), then you cannot overpower him, and if he is not, then there is no use of murdering him."" (Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ added): Later on Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) once again went along with Ubai bin Ka`b to the date-palm trees (garden) where Ibn Saiyad was staying. The Prophet (ﷺ) wanted to hear something from Ibn Saiyad before Ibn Saiyad could see him, and the Prophet (ﷺ) saw him lying covered with a sheet and from where his murmurs were heard. Ibn Saiyad's mother saw Allah's Apostle while he was hiding himself behind the trunks of the date-palm trees. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, ""O Saf ! (and this was the name of Ibn Saiyad) Here is Muhammad."" And with that Ibn Saiyad got up. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Had this woman left him (Had she not disturbed him), then Ibn Saiyad would have revealed the reality of his case. Shoaib mentioned in his Hadith ''فَرَفَصَهُ رَمْرَمَةٌ'' or ''زَمْزَمَةٌ'' whereas Oqail said: ''رَمْزَةٌ'' and Mamar said: ''زَمْزَمَةٌ''",Funerals (Al-Janaa'iz),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih

1358,Narrated Ibn Shihab:,"The funeral prayer should be offered for every child even if he were the son of a prostitute as he was born with a true faith of Islam (i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone). If his parents are Muslims, particularly the father, even if his mother were a non-Muslim, and if he after the delivery cries (even once) before his death (i.e. born alive) then the funeral prayer must be offered. And if the child does not cry after his delivery (i.e. born dead) then his funeral prayer should not be offered, and he will be considered as a miscarriage. Abu Huraira, narrated that the Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Every child is born with a true faith (i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone) but his parents convert him to Judaism or to Christianity or to Magainism, as an animal delivers a perfect baby animal. Do you find it mutilated?"" Then Abu Huraira recited the holy verses: 'The pure Allah's Islamic nature (true faith i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone), with which He has created human beings.'

Do you find it mutilated?"" Then Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ recited the holy verses: ""The pure Allah's Islamic nature (true faith of Islam) (i.e. worshipping none but Allah) with which He has created human beings. No change let there be in the religion of Allah (i.e. joining none in worship with Allah). That is the straight religion (Islam) but most of men know, not.""

1360,Narrated Sa`id bin Al-Musaiyab from his father:,"When the time of the death of Abu Talib approached, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went to him and found Abu Jahl bin Hisham and `Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya bin Al-Mughira by his side. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to Abu Talib, ""O uncle! Say: None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, a sentence with which I shall be a witness (i.e. argue) for you before Allah. Abu Jahl and `Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya said, ""O Abu Talib! Are you going to denounce the religion of `Abdul Muttalib?"" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept on inviting Abu Talib to say it (i.e. 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah') while they (Abu Jahl and `Abdullah) kept on repeating their statement till Abu Talib said as his last statement that he was on the religion of `Abdul Muttalib and refused to say, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.' (Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""I will keep on asking Allah's forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden (by Allah) to do so."" So Allah revealed (the verse) concerning him (i.e. It is not fitting for the Prophet (ﷺ) and those who believe that they should invoke (Allah) for forgiveness for pagans even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of the fire (9.113).",Funerals (Al-Janaa'iz),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih

He then took a green leaf of a date-palm tree split it into two pieces and fixed one on each grave. The people said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Why have you done so?"" He replied, ""I hope that their punishment may be lessened till they (the leaf) become dry.""",Funerals (Al-Janaa'iz),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1362,Narrated `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ :,""" We were accompanying a funeral procession in Baqi-I-Gharqad. The Prophet (ﷺ) came to us and sat and we sat around him.

He then said, ""There is none among you, and not a created soul, but has place either in Paradise or in Hell assigned for him and it is also determined for him whether he will be among the blessed or wretched.""

And whoever commits suicide with piece of iron will be punished with the same piece of iron in the Hell Fire.""Hadrat Hasan Basri reports that Hadrat Jundab رضی اللہ عنہ narrated this Hadith to us in this Mosque. So, we neither forget it nor do we have fear that Jundab will tell a false statement assigning it to the prophet .
