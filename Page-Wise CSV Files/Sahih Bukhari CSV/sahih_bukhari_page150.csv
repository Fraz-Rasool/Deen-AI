3905,Narrated 'Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا (the wife of the Prophet) :,"I never remembered my parents believing in any religion other than the true religion (i.e. Islam), and (I don't remember) a single day passing without our being visited by Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in the morning and in the evening. When the Muslims were put to test (i.e. troubled by the pagans), Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ set out migrating to the land of Ethiopia, and when he reached Bark-al-Ghimad, Ibn Ad-Daghina, the chief of the tribe of Qara, met him and said, ""O Abu Bakr! Where are you going?"" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ replied, ""My people have turned me out (of my country), so I want to wander on the earth and worship my Lord."" Ibn Ad-Daghina said, ""O Abu Bakr! A man like you should not leave his home-land, nor should he be driven out, because you help the destitute, earn their livings, and you keep good relations with your Kith and kin, help the weak and poor, entertain guests generously, and help the calamity-stricken persons. Therefore I am your protector. Go back and worship your Lord in your town."" So Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ returned and Ibn Ad-Daghina accompanied him. In the evening Ibn Ad-Daghina visited the nobles of Quraish and said to them. ""A man like Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ should not leave his homeland, nor should he be driven out. Do you (i.e. Quraish) drive out a man who helps the destitute, earns their living, keeps good relations with his Kith and kin, helps the weak and poor, entertains guests generously and helps the calamity-stricken persons?"" So the people of Quraish could not refuse Ibn Ad-Daghina's protection, and they said to Ibn Ad-Daghina, ""Let Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ worship his Lord in his house. He can pray and recite there whatever he likes, but he should not hurt us with it, and should not do it publicly, because we are afraid that he may affect our women and children."" Ibn Ad-Daghina told Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ of all that. Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ stayed in that state, worshipping his Lord in his house. He did not pray publicly, nor did he recite Quran outside his house. Then a thought occurred to Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ to build a mosque in front of his house, and there he used to pray and recite the Quran. The women and children of the pagans began to gather around him in great number. They used to wonder at him and look at him. Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ was a man who used to weep too much, and he could not help weeping on reciting the Quran. That situation scared the nobles of the pagans of Quraish, so they sent for Ibn Ad-Daghina. When he came to them, they said, ""We accepted your protection of Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ on condition that he should worship his Lord in his house, but he has violated the conditions and he has built a mosque in front of his house where he prays and recites the Quran publicly. We are now afraid that he may affect our women and children unfavorably. So, prevent him from that. If he likes to confine the worship of his Lord to his house, he may do so, but if he insists on doing that openly, ask him to release you from your obligation to protect him, for we dislike to break our pact with you, but we deny Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ the right to announce his act publicly."" Ibn Ad-Daghina went to Abu- Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ and said, (""O Abu Bakr!) You know well what contract I have made on your behalf; now, you are either to abide by it, or else release me from my obligation of protecting you, because I do not want the 'Arabs hear that my people have dishonored a contract I have made on behalf of another man."" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ replied, ""I release you from your pact to protect me, and am pleased with the protection from Allah."" At that time the Prophet (ﷺ) was in Mecca, and he said to the Muslims, ""In a dream I have been shown your migration place, a land of date palm trees, between two mountains, the two stony tracts."" So, some people migrated to Medina, and most of those people who had previously migrated to the land of Ethiopia, returned to Medina. Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ also prepared to leave for Medina, but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him, ""Wait for a while, because I hope that I will be allowed to migrate also."" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Do you indeed expect this? Let my father be sacrificed for you!"" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Yes."" So Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ did not migrate for the sake of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in order to accompany him. He fed two she-camels he possessed with the leaves of As-Samur tree that fell on being struck by a stick for four months. One day, while we were sitting in Abu Bakr's house at noon, someone said to Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ , ""This is Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) with his head covered coming at a time at which he never used to visit us before."" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""May my parents be sacrificed for him. By Allah, he has not come at this hour except for a great necessity."" So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came and asked permission to enter, and he was allowed to enter. When he entered, he said to Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ . ""Tell everyone who is present with you to go away."" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ replied, ""There are none but your family. May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!"" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""i have been given permission to migrate."" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Shall I accompany you? May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!"" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""Yes."" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! May my father be sacrificed for you, take one of these two she-camels of mine."" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, ""(I will accept it) with payment."" So we prepared the baggage quickly and put some journey food in a leather bag for them. Asma, Abu Bakr's daughter, cut a piece from her waist belt and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it, and for that reason she was named Dhat-un-Nitaqain (i.e. the owner of two belts). Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ reached a cave on the mountain of Thaur and stayed there for three nights. 'Abdullah bin Abi Bakr who was intelligent and a sagacious youth, used to stay (with them) aver night. He used to leave them before day break so that in the morning he would be with Quraish as if he had spent the night in Mecca. He would keep in mind any plot made against them, and when it became dark he would (go and) inform them of it. 'Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ , used to bring the milch sheep (of his master, Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ) to them a little while after nightfall in order to rest the sheep there. So they always had fresh milk at night, the milk of their sheep, and the milk which they warmed by throwing heated stones in it. 'Amir bin Fuhaira would then call the herd away when it was still dark (before daybreak). He did the same in each of those three nights. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ had hired a man from the tribe of Bani Ad-Dail from the family of Bani Abd bin Adi as an expert guide, and he was in alliance with the family of Al-'As bin Wail As-Sahmi and he was on the religion of the infidels of Quraish. The Prophet (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ trusted him and gave him their two she-camels and took his promise to bring their two she camels to the cave of the mountain of Thaur in the morning after three nights later. And (when they set out), 'Amir bin Fuhaira and the guide went along with them and the guide led them along the sea-shore.",Merits of the Helpers in Madinah (Ansaar),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
3906,Narrated Suraqa bin Ju'sham رضی اللہ عنہ :,"""The messengers of the heathens of Quraish came to us declaring that they had assigned for the persons why would kill or arrest Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr, a reward equal to their bloodmoney. While I was sitting in one of the gatherings of my tribe. Bani Mudlij, a man from them came to us and stood up while we were sitting, and said, ""O Suraqa! No doubt, I have just seen some people far away on the seashore, and I think they are Muhammad and his companions."" Suraqa added, ""I too realized that it must have been they. But I said 'No, it is not they, but you have seen so-and-so, and so-and-so whom we saw set out.' I stayed in the gathering for a while and then got up and left for my home. and ordered my slave-girl to get my horse which was behind a hillock, and keep it ready for me. Then I took my spear and left by the back door of my house dragging the lower end of the spear on the ground and keeping it low. Then I reached my horse, mounted it and made it gallop. When I approached them (i.e. Muhammad and Abu Bakr), my horse stumbled and I fell down from it, Then I stood up, got hold of my quiver and took out the divining arrows and drew lots as to whether I should harm them (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr) or not, and the lot which I disliked came out. But I remounted my horse and let it gallop, giving no importance to the divining arrows. When I heard the recitation of the Quran by Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who did not look hither and thither while Abu Bakr was doing it often, suddenly the forelegs of my horse sank into the ground up to the knees, and I fell down from it. Then I rebuked it and it got up but could hardly take out its forelegs from the ground, and when it stood up straight again, its fore-legs caused dust to rise up in the sky like smoke. Then again I drew lots with the divining arrows, and the lot which I disliked, came out. So I called upon them to feel secure. They stopped, and I remounted my horse and went to them. When I saw how I had been hampered from harming them, it came to my mind that the cause of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (i.e. Islam) will become victorious. So I said to him, ""Your people have assigned a reward equal to the bloodmoney for your head."" Then I told them all the plans the people of Mecca had made concerning them. Then I offered them some journey food and goods but they refused to take anything and did not ask for anything, but the Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Do not tell others about us."" Then I requested him to write for me a statement of security and peace. He ordered 'Amr bin Fuhaira who wrote it for me on a parchment, and then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) proceeded on his way. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) met Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ in a caravan of Muslim merchants who were returning from Sham. Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ provided Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ with white clothes to wear. When the Muslims of Medina heard the news of the departure of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) from Mecca (towards Medina), they started going to the Harra every morning . They would wait for him till the heat of the noon forced them to return. One day, after waiting for a long while, they returned home, and when they went into their houses, a Jew climbed up the roof of one of the forts of his people to look for some thing, and he saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his companions dressed in white clothes, emerging out of the desert mirage. The Jew could not help shouting at the top of his voice, ""O you 'Arabs! Here is your great man whom you have been waiting for!"" So all the Muslims rushed to their arms and received Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on the summit of Harra. The Prophet (ﷺ) turned with them to the right and alighted at the quarters of Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf, and this was on Monday in the month of Rabi-ul-Awal. Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ stood up, receiving the people while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sat down and kept silent. Some of the Ansar who came and had not seen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) before, began greeting Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ, but when the sunshine fell on Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ came forward and shaded him with his sheet only then the people came to know Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stayed with Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf for ten nights and established the mosque (mosque of Quba) which was founded on piety. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) prayed in it and then mounted his she-camel and proceeded on, accompanied by the people till his she-camel knelt down at (the place of) the Mosque of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) at Medina. Some Muslims used to pray there in those days, and that place was a yard for drying dates belonging to Suhail and Sahl, the orphan boys who were under the guardianship of 'Asad bin Zurara. When his she-camel knelt down, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""This place, Allah willing, will be our abiding place."" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then called the two boys and told them to suggest a price for that yard so that he might take it as a mosque. The two boys said, ""No, but we will give it as a gift, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!"" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then built a mosque there. The Prophet (ﷺ) himself started carrying unburnt bricks for its building and while doing so, he was saying ""This load is better than the load of Khaibar, for it is more pious in the Sight of Allah and purer and better rewardable."" He was also saying, ""O Allah! The actual reward is the reward in the Hereafter, so bestow Your Mercy on the Ansar and the Emigrants."" Thus the Prophet (ﷺ) recited (by way of proverb) the poem of some Muslim poet whose name is unknown to me. (Ibn Shibab said, ""In the Hadiths it does not occur that Allah's Apostle recited a complete poetic verse other than this one."")",Merits of the Helpers in Madinah (Ansaar),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
3907,Narrated Asma رضی اللہ عنہا :,"I prepared the journey food for the Prophet (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr when they wanted (to migrate to) Medina. I said to my father (Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ), ""I do not have anything to tie the container of the journey food with except my waist belt."" He said, ""Divide it lengthwise into two."" I did so, and for this reason I was named 'Dhat-un-Nitaqain' (i.e. the owner of two belts). (Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما said, ""Asma', Dhat-un-Nitaq."")",Merits of the Helpers in Madinah (Ansaar),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
3908,Narrated Al-Bara رضی اللہ عنہ :,"When the Prophet (ﷺ) migrated to Medina, Suraqa bin Malik bin Ju'sham pursued him. The Prophet (ﷺ) invoked evil on him, therefore the forelegs of his horse sank into the ground. Suraqa said (to the Prophet ), ""Invoke Allah to rescue me, and I will not harm you. ""The Prophet (ﷺ) invoked Allah for him. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) felt thirsty and he passed by a shepherd. Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I took a bowl and milked a little milk in it and brought it to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he drank till I was pleased.""",Merits of the Helpers in Madinah (Ansaar),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
3909,Narrated Asma رضی اللہ عنہا :,"She conceived `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہا . She added, ""I migrated to Medina while I was at full term of pregnancy and alighted at Quba where I gave birth to him. Then I brought him to the Prophet (ﷺ) and put him in his lap. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked for a date, chewed it, and put some of its juice in the child's mouth. So, the first thing that entered the child's stomach was the saliva of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Then the Prophet rubbed the child's palate with a date and invoked for Allah's Blessings on him, and he was the first child born amongst the Emigrants in the Islamic Land (i.e. Medina). Similarly, Khalid bin Makhlad, Ali bin Mushir, Hisham, Urwah has reported from Hadrat from Asma رضی اللہ عنہا that when she migrated to the Prophet (ﷺ), she was Pregnant.",Merits of the Helpers in Madinah (Ansaar),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

So the first thing that went into the child's stomach, was the saliva of the Prophet.",Merits of the Helpers in Madinah (Ansaar),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
3911,Narrated Anas bin Malik رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) arrived at Medina with Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ , riding behind him on the same camel. Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ was an elderly man known to the people, while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was a youth that was unknown. Thus, if a man met Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ , he would say, ""O Abu Bakr! Who is this man in front of you?"" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ would say, ""This man shows me the Way,"" One would think that Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ meant the road, while in fact, Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ the way of virtue and good. Then Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ looked behind and saw a horse-rider pursuing them. He said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! This is a horse-rider pursuing us."" The Prophet (ﷺ) looked behind and said, ""O Allah! Cause him to fall down."" So the horse threw him down and got up neighing. After that the rider, Suraqa said, ""O Allah's Prophet! Order me whatever you want."" The Prophet said, ""Stay where you are and do not allow anybody to reach us."" So, in the first part of the day Suraqa was an enemy of Allah's Prophet and in the last part of it, he was a protector. Then Allah's Apostle alighted by the side of the Al-Harra and sent a message to the Ansar, and they came to Allah's Prophet and Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ , and having greeted them, they said, ""Ride (your she-camels) safe and obeyed."" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ rode and the Ansar, carrying their arms, surrounded them. The news that Allah's Prophet had come circulated in Medina. The people came out and were eagerly looking and saying ""Allah's Prophet has come! Allah's Prophet has come! So the Prophet (ﷺ) went on till he alighted near the house of Abu Ayub رضی اللہ عنہ . While the Prophet (ﷺ) was speaking with the family members of Abu Ayub رضی اللہ عنہ , `Abdullah bin Salam heard the news of his arrival while he himself was picking the dates for his family from his family garden. He hurried to the Prophet (ﷺ) carrying the dates which he had collected for his family from the garden. He listened to Allah's Prophet and then went home. Then Allah's Prophet said, ""Which is the nearest of the houses of our kith and kin?"" Abu Ayub رضی اللہ عنہ replied, ""Mine, O Allah's Prophet! This is my house and this is my gate."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Go and prepare a place for our midday rest."" Abu Ayub رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Get up (both of you) with Allah's Blessings."" So when Allah's Prophet went into the house, `Abdullah bin Salam رضی اللہ عنہ came and said ""I testify that you (i.e. Muhammad) are Apostle of Allah and that you have come with the Truth. The Jews know well that I am their chief and the son of their chief and the most learned amongst them and the son of the most learned amongst them. So send for them (i.e. Jews) and ask them about me before they know that I have embraced Islam, for if they know that they will say about me things which are not correct."" So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent for them, and they came and entered. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to them, ""O (the group of) Jews! Woe to you: be afraid of Allah. By Allah except Whom none has the right to be worshipped, you people know for certain, that I am Apostle of Allah and that I have come to you with the Truth, so embrace Islam."" The Jews replied, ""We do not know this."" So they said this to the Prophet and he repeated it thrice. Then he said, ""What sort of a man is `Abdullah bin Salam رضی اللہ عنہ amongst you?"" They said, ""He is our chief and the son of our chief and the most learned man, and the son of the most learned amongst us."" He said, ""What would you think if he should embrace Islam?"" They said, ""Allah forbid! He can not embrace Islam."" He said, "" What would you think if he should embrace Islam?"" They said, ""Allah forbid! He can not embrace Islam."" He said, ""What would you think if he should embrace Islam?"" They said, ""Allah forbid! He can not embrace Islam."" He said, ""O Ibn Salam! Come out to them."" He came out and said, ""O (the group of) Jews! Be afraid of Allah except Whom none has the right to be worshipped. You know for certain that he is Apostle of Allah and that he has brought a True Religion!' They said, ""You tell a lie."" On that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) turned them out.",Merits of the Helpers in Madinah (Ansaar),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

Somebody said to `Umar, ""Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما is also one of the Early Emigrants; why do you give him less than four-thousand?"" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ replied, ""His parents took him with them when they migrated, so he was not like the one who had migrated by himself.",Merits of the Helpers in Madinah (Ansaar),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

3914,Narrated Khabbab رضی اللہ عنہ :,"We migrated with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) seeking Allah's Countenance, so our rewards became due and sure with Allah. Some of us passed away without eating anything of their rewards in this world. One of these was Mus`ab bin `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ who was martyred on the day of the battle of Uhud. We did not find anything to shroud his body with except a striped cloak. When we covered his head with it, his feet remained uncovered, and when we covered his feet with it, his head remained uncovered. So Allah's Apostle ordered us to cover his head with it and put some Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass) over his feet. And there are some amongst us whose fruits have ripened and they are collecting them (i.e. they have received their rewards in this world).",Merits of the Helpers in Madinah (Ansaar),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
3915,Narrated Abu Burda Bin Abi Musa Al-Ash`ari:,"`Abdullah bin `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما said to me, ""Do you know what my father said to your father once?""

Your father (i.e. Abu Musa رضی اللہ عنہ) said, 'No, by Allah, we took part in Jihad after Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) , prayed and did plenty of good deeds, and many people have embraced Islam at our hands, and no doubt, we expect rewards from Allah for these good deeds.' On that my father (i.e. `Umar) said, 'As for myself, By Him in Whose Hand `Umar's soul is, I wish that the deeds done by us at the time of the Prophet (ﷺ) remain rewardable while whatsoever we did after the death of the Prophet (ﷺ) be enough to save us from Punishment in that the good deeds compensate for the bad ones.'

Then `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ sent me again (to the Prophet (ﷺ) ) and said, 'Go and see whether he is awake.' I went to him and entered his place and gave him the pledge of allegiance. Then I went back to `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ and informed him that the Prophet (ﷺ) was awake.

I went out to guard him and all of a sudden I saw a shepherd coming with his sheep looking for the same, the shade of the rock as we did, I asked him, 'O boy, to whom do you belong?' He replied, 'I belong to so-and-so.' I asked him, 'Is there some milk in your sheep?' He replied in the affirmative. I asked him, 'Will you milk?' He replied in the affirmative.

3926,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal got fever, and I went to both of them and said, ""O my father, how do you feel? O Bilal, how do you feel?"" Whenever Abu Bakr's fever got worse, he would say, ""Every man will meet his death once in one morning while he will be among his family, for death is really nearer to him than his leather shoe laces (to his feet)."" And whenever fever deserted Bilal, he would say aloud, ""Would that I know whether I shall spend a night in the valley (of Mecca) with Idhkhir and Jalil (i.e. kinds of grass) around me, and whether I shall drink one day the water of Mijannah, and whether I shall see once again the hills of Shamah and Tafil?"" Then I went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and told him of that. He said, ""O Allah, make us love Medina as much as or more than we used to love Mecca, O Allah, make it healthy and bless its Sa' and Mud (i.e. measures), and take away its fever to Al-Juhfa.""",Merits of the Helpers in Madinah (Ansaar),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
3927,Narrated 'Ubaidullah bin Ad bin Khiyair:,"I went to `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ . After reciting Tashah-hud, he said,. ""Then after no doubt, Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth, and I was amongst those who responded to the Call of Allah and His Prophet and believed in the message of Muhammad. Then took part in the two migrations. I became the son-in-law of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and gave the pledge of allegiance to him By Allah, I never disobeyed him, nor did I deceive him till Allah took him unto Him."" Along with Shoaib, Ishaq Kalbi also followed this tradition, from whom Zahri narrated this hadith in the same way.",Merits of the Helpers in Madinah (Ansaar),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
3928,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"During the last Hajj led by `Umar, `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf رضی اللہ عنہ returned to his family at Mina and met me there. `Abdur Rahman said (to `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ ), ""O chief of the believers! The season of Hajj is the season when there comes the scum of the people (besides the good amongst them), so I recommend that you should wait till you go back to Medina, for it is the place of Migration and Sunna (i.e. the Prophet's tradition), and there you will be able to refer the matter to the religious scholars and the nobles and the people of wise opinions."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I will speak of it in Medina on my very first sermon I will deliver there.""",Merits of the Helpers in Madinah (Ansaar),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
3929,Narrated 'Um Al-`Ala رضی اللہ عنہا :,"An Ansari woman who gave the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet (ﷺ) that the Ansar drew lots concerning the dwelling of the Emigrants. `Uthman bin Maz'un was decided to dwell with them (i.e. Um Al-`Ala's family), `Uthman fell ill and I nursed him till he died, and we covered him with his clothes. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) came to us and I (addressing the dead body) said, ""O Abu As-Sa'ib, may Allah's Mercy be on you! I bear witness that Allah has honored you."" On that the Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""How do you know that Allah has honored him?"" I replied, ""I do not know. May my father and my mother be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! But who else is worthy of it (if not `Uthman)?"" He said, ""As to him, by Allah, death has overtaken him, and I hope the best for him. By Allah, though I am the Apostle of Allah, yet I do not know what Allah will do to me,"" By Allah, I will never assert the piety of anyone after him. That made me sad, and when I slept I saw in a dream a flowing stream for `Uthman bin Maz'un. I went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and told him of it. He remarked, ""That symbolizes his (good) deeds.""",Merits of the Helpers in Madinah (Ansaar),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
