771,Narrated Saiyar bin Salama:,"My father and I went to Abu Barza-al-Aslami رضی اللہ عنہ to ask him about the stated times for the prayers. He replied, ""The Prophet (ﷺ) used to offer the Zuhr prayer when the sun just declined from its highest position at noon; the `Asr at a time when if a man went to the farthest place in Medina (after praying) he would find the sun still hot (bright). (The sub narrator said: I have forgotten what Abu Barza said about the Maghrib prayer). The Prophet (ﷺ) never found any harm in delaying the `Isha' prayer to the first third of the night and he never liked to sleep before it and to talk after it. He used to offer the morning prayer at a time when after finishing it one could recognize the person sitting beside him and used to recite between 60 to 100 verses in one or both the rak`at.""",Call to Prayers (Adhaan) (Sufa-Tu-Salat),Sahih Bukhari,1,Sahih

They said, ""A barrier has been placed between us and the news of heaven. And fire has been thrown at us.""

Go eastward and westward and see what has put a barrier between you and the news of heaven."" Those who went towards Tuhama came across the Prophet at a place called Nakhla and it was on the way to Suq `Ukaz and the Prophet (ﷺ) was offering the Fajr prayer with his companions.

Verily there was a good example for you in the ways of the Prophet. Anas said: Hadrat Anas رضی اللہ عنہ One of the Ansar used to lead the Ansar in Salat in the Quba' mosque and it was his habit to recite Qul Huwal-lahu Ahad whenever he wanted to recite something in Salat. When he finished that Surah, he would recite another one with it. He followed the same procedure in each Rak'a. His companions discussed this with him and said, ""You recite this Surah and do not consider it sufficient and then you recite another. So would you recite it alone or leave it and recite some other."" He said, ""I will never leave it and if you want me to be your Imam on this condition then it is all right ; otherwise I will leave you."" They knew that he was the best amongst them and they did not like someone else to lead them in Salat. When the Prophet (ﷺ) went to them as usual, they informed him about it. The Prophet (ﷺ) addressed him and said, ""O so-and-so, what forbids you from doing what your companions ask you to do ? Why do you read this Surah particularly in every Rak'a ?""
