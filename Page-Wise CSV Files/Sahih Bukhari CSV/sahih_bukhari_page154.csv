"4033, 4034",Narrated Malik bin Aus Al-Hadathan An-Nasri:,"Once `Umar bin Al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ called him and while he was sitting with him, his gatekeeper, Yarfa came and said, ""Will you admit `Uthman, `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf, Az Zubair and Sa`d (bin Abi Waqqas رضی اللہ عنہم ) who are waiting for your permission?"" `Umar said, ""Yes, let them come in."" After a while, Yarfa- came again and said, ""Will you admit `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ and `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ who are asking your permission?"" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Yes."" So, when the two entered, `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""O chief of the believers! Judge between me and this (i.e. `Ali). ""Both of them had a dispute regarding the property of Bani An-Nadir which Allah had given to His Apostle as Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting), `Ali and `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ started reproaching each other. The (present) people (i.e. `Uthman and his companions) said, ""O chief of the believers! Give your verdict in their case and relieve each from) the other."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Wait I beseech you, by Allah, by Whose Permission both the heaven and the earth stand fast! Do you know that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'We (Prophets) our properties are not to be inherited, and whatever we leave, is to be spent in charity,' and he said it about himself?"" They (i.e. `Uthman and his company) said, ""He did say it. ""`Umar رضی اللہ عنہ then turned towards `Ali and `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ and said, ""I beseech you both, by Allah! Do you know that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said this?"" They replied in the affirmative. He said, ""Now I am talking to you about this matter. Allah the Glorified favored His Apostle with something of this Fai (i.e. booty won without fighting) which He did not give to anybody else. Allah said:-- ""And what Allah gave to His Apostle (""Fai"""" Booty) from them--For which you made no expedition With either Calvary or camelry. But Allah gives power to His Apostles Over whomsoever He will And Allah is able to do all things."" (59.6) So this property was especially granted to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . But by Allah, the Prophet (ﷺ) neither took it all for himself only, nor deprived you of it, but he gave it to all of you and distributed it amongst you till only this remained out of it. And from this Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to spend the yearly maintenance for his family, and whatever used to remain, he used to spend it where Allah's Property is spent (i.e. in charity), Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept on acting like that during all his life, Then he died, and Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, 'I am the successor of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).' So he (i.e. Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ ) took charge of this property and disposed of it in the same manner as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to do, and all of you (at that time) knew all about it."" Then `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ turned towards `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ and `Abbas and said, ""You both remember that Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ disposed of it in the way you have described and Allah knows that, in that matter, he was sincere, pious, rightly guided and the follower of the right. Then Allah caused Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ to die and I said, 'I am the successor of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ .' So I kept this property in my possession for the first two years of my rule (i.e. Caliphate and I used to dispose of it in the same wa as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ used to do; and Allah knows that I have been sincere, pious, rightly guided an the follower of the right (in this matte Later on both of you (i.e. `Ali and `Abbas) came to me, and the claim of you both was one and the same, O `Abbas! You also came to me. So I told you both that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""Our property is not inherited, but whatever we leave is to be given in charity.' Then when I thought that I should better hand over this property to you both or the condition that you will promise and pledge before Allah that you will dispose it off in the same way as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ did and as I have done since the beginning of my caliphate or else you should not speak to me (about it).' So, both of you said to me, 'Hand it over to us on this condition.' And on this condition I handed it over to you. Do you want me now to give a decision other than that (decision)? By Allah, with Whose Permission both the sky and the earth stand fast, I will never give any decision other than that (decision) till the Last Hour is established. But if you are unable to manage it (i.e. that property), then return it to me, and I will manage on your behalf."" The sub-narrator said, ""I told `Urwa bin Az-Zubair of this Hadith and he said, 'Malik bin Aus has told the truth"" I heard `Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) saying, 'The wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) sent `Uthman to Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ demanding from him their 1/8 of the Fai which Allah had granted to his Apostle. But I used to oppose them and say to them: Will you not fear Allah? Don't you know that the Prophet used to say: Our property is not inherited, but whatever we leave is to be given in charity? The Prophet (ﷺ) mentioned that regarding himself. He added: 'The family of Muhammad can take their sustenance from this property. So the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) stopped demanding it when I told them of that.' So, this property (of Sadaqa) was in the hands of `Ali who withheld it from `Abbas and overpowered him. Then it came in the hands of Hasan bin `Ali, then in the hands of Husain bin `Ali, and then in the hands of `Ali bin Husain and Hasan bin Hasan, and each of the last two used to manage it in turn, then it came in the hands of Zaid bin Hasan, and it was truly the Sadaqa of Allah's Apostle .""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) saying, 'Our property is not inherited, and whatever we leave is to be given in charity. But the family of Muhammad can take their sustenance from this property.' By Allah, I would love to do good to the Kith and kin of Allah's Apostle rather than to my own Kith and kin.""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
