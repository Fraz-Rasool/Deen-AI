4674,Narrated Samura bin Jundab رضى الله عنه :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""Tonight two (visitors) came to me (in my dream) and took me to a town built with gold bricks and silver bricks. There we met men who, half of their bodies, look like the mosthandsome human beings you have ever seen, and the other half, the ugliest human beings you have ever seen. Those two visitors said to those men, 'Go and dip yourselves in that river. So they dipped themselves therein and then came to us, their ugliness having disappeared and they were in the mosthandsome shape. The visitors said, 'The first is the Garden of Eden and that is your dwelling place.' Then they added, 'As for those people who were half ugly and half handsome, they were those who mixed good deeds and bad deeds, but Allah forgave them.""",Prophetic Commentary on the Qur'an (Tafseer of the Prophet (PBUH)),Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih
4675,Narrated Al-Musaiyab:,"When Abu Talib's death approached, the Prophet (ﷺ) went to him while Abu Jahl and `Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya were present with him. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""O uncle, say: None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, so that I may argue for your case with it before Allah."" On that, Abu Jahl and `Abdullah bin Abu Umaiya said, ""O Abu Talib! Do you want to renounce `Abdul Muttalib's religion?"" Then the Prophet said, ""I will keep on asking (Allah for) forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden to do so."" Then there was revealed:-- 'It is not fitting for the Prophet (ﷺ) and those who believe that they should invoke (Allah) for forgiveness for pagans even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of the Fire.'

4676,Narrated `Abdullah bin Ka`b:,"He out of Hadrat Ka'b's sons would lead his father when he turned blind, that he heard Ka`b bin Malik رضی اللہ عنہ talking about the Verse:-- 'And to the three (He also forgave) who remained behind.' (9.118) saying in the last portion of his talk, ""(I said), 'As a part (sign) of my repentance, I would like to give up all my property in the cause of Allah and His Apostle,' The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me, 'Keep some of your wealth as it is good for you."" (To the three (He also forgave) who remained behind till for them the earth, vast as it is, was straitened...""

4677,Narrated `Abdullah bin Ka`b:,"I heard Ka`b bin Malik رضی اللہ عنہ who was one of the three who were forgiven, saying that he had never remained behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in any Ghazwa which he had fought except two Ghazwat Ghazwat- Al-`Usra (Tabuk) and Ghazwat-Badr. He added. ""I decided to tell the truth to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in the forenoon, and scarcely did he return from a journey he made, except in the forenoon, he would go first to the mosque and offer a two-rak`at prayer. The Prophet (ﷺ) forbade others to speak to me or to my two companions, but he did not prohibit speaking to any of those who had remained behind excepting us. So the people avoided speaking to us, and I stayed in that state till I could no longer bear it, and the only thing that worried me was that I might die and the Prophet (ﷺ) would not offer the funeral prayer for me, or Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) might die and I would be left in that social status among the people that nobody would speak to me or offer the funeral prayer for me. But Allah revealed His Forgiveness for us to the Prophet (ﷺ) in the last third of the night while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was with Um Salama رضی اللہ عنہا . Um Salama رضی اللہ عنہا sympathized with me and helped me in my disaster. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'O Um Salama! Ka`b has been forgiven!' She said, 'Shall I send someone to him to give him the good tidings?' He said, 'If you did so, the people would not let you sleep the rest of the night.' So when the Prophet (ﷺ) had offered the Fajr prayer, he announced Allah's Forgiveness for us. His face used to look as bright as a piece of the (full) moon whenever he was pleased. When Allah revealed His Forgiveness for us, we were the three whose case had been deferred while the excuse presented by those who had apologized had been accepted. But when there were mentioned those who had told the Prophet (ﷺ) lies and remained behind (the battle of Tabuk) and had given false excuses, they were described with the worse description one may be described with. Allah said: 'They will present their excuses to you (Muslims) when you return to them. Say: Present no excuses; we shall not believe you. Allah has already informed us of the true state of matters concerning you. Allah and His Apostle will observe your actions.""

4678,Narrated `Abdullah bin Ka`b:,"He used to accompany Ka'b bin Malik. I heard Ka`b bin Malik رضی اللہ عنہ talking about the story of the battle of Tabuk when he remained behind, ""By Allah, I do not know anyone whom Allah has helped for telling the truth more than me since I mentioned that truth to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. And Allah revealed to His Apostle: ""Verily! Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin............ and be with those who are true (in words and deeds).""

4679,Narrated Zaid bin Thabit Al-Ansari رضی اللہ عنہ :,"When the Muslims were fighting with the people of Yamamah, who was one of those who used to write the Divine Revelation: Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ sent for me after the (heavy) casualties among the warriors (of the battle) of Yamama (where a great number of Qurra' were killed). `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ was present with Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ who said, `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ has come to me and said, The people have suffered heavy casualties on the day of (the battle of) Yamama, and I am afraid that there will be more casualties among the Qurra' (those who know the Qur'an by heart) at other battle-fields, whereby a large part of the Qur'an may be lost, unless you collect it. And I am of the opinion that you should collect the Qur'an."" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ added, ""I said to `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ , 'How can I do something which Allah's Apostle has not done?' `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said (to me), 'By Allah, it is (really) a good thing.' So `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ kept on pressing, trying to persuade me to accept his proposal, till Allah opened my bosom for it and I had the same opinion as `Umar."" (Zaid bin Thabit added:) `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ was sitting with him (Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ ) and was not speaking. me). ""You are a wise young man and we do not suspect you (of telling lies or of forgetfulness): and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Therefore, look for the Qur'an and collect it (in one manuscript). "" By Allah, if he (Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ ) had ordered me to shift one of the mountains (from its place) it would not have been harder for me than what he had ordered me concerning the collection of the Qur'an. I said to both of them, ""How dare you do a thing which the Prophet has not done?"" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""By Allah, it is (really) a good thing. So I kept on arguing with him about it till Allah opened my bosom for that which He had opened the bosoms of Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ and `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ . So I started locating Qur'anic material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leaf-stalks of date palms and from the memories of men (who knew it by heart). I found with Khuza`ima two Verses of Surat-at-Tauba which I had not found with anybody else, (and they were):-- ""Verily there has come to you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty He (Muhammad) is ardently anxious over you (to be rightly guided)"" (9.128) The manuscript on which the Qur'an was collected, remained with Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ till Allah took him unto Him, and then with `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ till Allah took him unto Him, and finally it remained with Hafsa, `Umar's daughter.

4682,Narrated Muhammad bin `Abbas bin Ja`far:,"Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما recited. ""No doubt! They fold up their breasts."" I said, ""O Abu `Abbas! What is meant by ""They fold up their breasts?""

He also said, ""Do you see what He has spent since He created the Heavens and the Earth? Nevertheless, what is in His Hand is not decreased, and His Throne was over the water; and in His Hand there is the balance (of justice) whereby He raises and lowers (people). ''اعْتَرَاكَ‏'': smite you with something. ''عَرَوْتُهُ'': I found him ''لعروہ'' and ''اعتران'' have been derived from that. ''آخِذٌ بِنَاصِيَتِهَا‏'': is in his kingdom and power. ''عَنِيدٌ'', ''عَنُودٌ'' and ''عَانِدٌ'' are synonyms. i.e. extremely headstrong.

(Allah will ask him), 'Do you know (that you did) 'such-and-such sin?"" He will say twice, 'Yes, I do.' Then Allah will say, 'I concealed it in the world and I forgive it for you today.'
