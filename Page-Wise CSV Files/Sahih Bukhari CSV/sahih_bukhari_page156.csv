4064,Narrated Anas رضی اللہ عنہ :,"When it was the day of Uhud, the people left the Prophet (ﷺ) while Abu Talha رضی اللہ عنہ was in front of the Prophet (ﷺ) shielding him with his leather shield. Abu Talha رضی اللہ عنہ was a skillful archer who used to shoot violently. He broke two or three arrow bows on that day. If a man carrying a quiver full of arrows passed by, the Prophet would say (to him), put (scatter) its contents for Abu Talha رضی اللہ عنہ ."" The Prophet (ﷺ) would raise his head to look at the enemy, whereupon Abu Talha رضی اللہ عنہ would say, ""Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you ! Do not raise your head, lest an arrow of the enemy should hit you. (Let) my neck (be struck) rather than your neck."" I saw `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا , the daughter of Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہا, and Um Sulaim رضی اللہ عنہا rolling up their dresses so that I saw their leg-bangles while they were carrying water skins on their backs and emptying them in the mouths of the (wounded) people. They would return to refill them and again empty them in the mouths of the (wounded) people. The sword fell from Abu Talha's hand twice or thrice (on that day).",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4065,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"When it was the day of Uhud, the pagans were defeated. Then Satan, Allah's Curse be upon him, cried loudly, ""O Allah's Worshippers, beware of what is behind!"" On that, the front files of the (Muslim) forces turned their backs and started fighting with the back files. Hudhaifa looked, and on seeing his father Al-Yaman, he shouted, ""O Allah's Worshippers, my father, my father!"" But by Allah, they did not stop till they killed him. Hudhaifa said, ""May Allah forgive you."" (The sub-narrator, `Urwa, said, ""By Allah, Hudhaifa continued asking Allah's Forgiveness for the killers of his father till he departed to Allah (i.e. died)."") (Imam Bukhari) says that he thinks: (بصرت) is in fact from '' الْبَصِيرَةِ '' regarding affair; and '' أبصرت '' means to see by an eye. The other people say that بصرت and أبصرت are synonyms.",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4066,Narrated `Uthman bin Mauhab:,"A man came to perform the Hajj to (Allah's) House. Seeing some people sitting, he said, ""Who are these sitting people?"" Somebody said, ""They are the people of Quraish."" He said, ""Who is the old man?"" They said, ""Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما ."" He went to him and said, ""I want to ask you about something; will you tell me about it? I ask you with the respect due to the sanctity of this (Sacred) House, do you know that `Uthman bin `Affan رضی اللہ عنہ fled on the day of Uhud?"" Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Yes."" He said, ""Do you know that he (i.e. `Uthman) was absent from the Badr (battle) and did not join it?"" Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Yes."" He said, ""Do you know that he failed to be present at the Ridwan Pledge of allegiance (i.e. Pledge of allegiance at Hudaibiya) and did not witness it?"" Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ replied, ""Yes,"" He then said, ""Allahu- Akbar!"" Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Come along; I will inform you and explain to you what you have asked. As for the flight (of `Uthman) on the day of Uhud, I testify that Allah forgave him. As regards his absence from the Badr (battle), he was married to the daughter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and she was ill, so the Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, 'You will have such reward as a man who has fought the Badr battle will get, and will also have the same share of the booty.' As for his absence from the Ridwan Pledge of allegiance if there had been anybody more respected by the Meccans than `Uthman bin `Affan رضی اللہ عنہ , the Prophet would surely have sent that man instead of `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ. So the Prophet (ﷺ) sent him (i.e. `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ to Mecca) and the Ridwan Pledge of allegiance took place after `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ had gone to Mecca. The Prophet raised his right hand saying. 'This is the hand of `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ ,' and clapped it over his other hand and said, ""This is for `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ .'"" Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ then said (to the man), ""Go now, after taking this information.""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4067,Narrated Al-Bara' bin `Azib رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) appointed `Abdullah bin Jubair رضی اللہ عنہما as the commander of the cavalry archers on the day of the battle of Uhud.

4069,Narrated Salim's father:,"He heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), when raising his head from bowing of the first rak`a of the morning prayer, saying, ""O Allah! Curse so-and-so and so-and-so"" after he had said, ""Allah hears him who sends his praises to Him. Our Lord, all the Praises are for you!"" So Allah revealed:-- ""Not for you (O Muhammad! )......(till the end of Verse) they are indeed wrong-doers.""

4071,Narrated Tha`laba bin Abi Malik:,"`Umar bin Al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ distributed woolen clothes amongst some women of Medina, and a nice woolen garment remained. Some of those who were sitting with him, said, ""O chief of the believers! Give it to the daughter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who is with you,"" and by that, they meant Um Kulthum, the daughter of `Ali رضی اللہ عنہا . `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Um Salit رضی اللہ عنہا has got more right than she."" Um Salit رضی اللہ عنہا was amongst those Ansari women who had given the pledge of allegiance to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ added, ""She (i.e. Um Salit رضی اللہ عنہا ) used to carry the filled water skins for us on the day of the battle of Uhud.""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4072,Narrated Jafar bin `Amr bin Umaiya رضی اللہ عنہ :,"I went out with 'Ubaidullah bin `Adi Al-Khaiyar رضی اللہ عنہ . When we reached Hims (i.e. a town in Syria), 'Ubaidullah bin `Adi رضی اللہ عنہ said (to me), ""Would you like to see Wahshi so that we may ask him about the killing of Hamza رضی اللہ عنہ ?"" I replied, ""Yes."" Wahshi used to live in Hims. We enquired about him and somebody said to us, ""He is that in the shade of his palace, as if he were a full water skin."" So we went up to him, and when we were at a short distance from him, we greeted him and he greeted us in return. 'Ubaidullah was wearing his turban and Wahshi could not see except his eyes and feet. 'Ubaidullah said, ""O Wahshi! Do you know me?"" Wahshi looked at him and then said, ""No, by Allah! But I know that `Adi bin Al-Khiyar married a woman called Um Qital, the daughter of Abu Al-Is, and she delivered a boy for him at Mecca, and I looked for a wet nurse for that child. (Once) I carried that child along with his mother and then I handed him over to her, and your feet resemble that child's feet."" Then 'Ubaidullah uncovered his face and said (to Wahshi), ""Will you tell us (the story of) the killing of Hamza رضی اللہ عنہ ?"" Wahshi replied ""Yes, Hamza رضی اللہ عنہ killed Tuaima bin `Adi bin Al-Khaiyar at Badr (battle) so my master, Jubair bin Mut`im said to me, 'If you kill Hamza in revenge for my uncle, then you will be set free."" When the people set out (for the battle of Uhud) in the year of 'Ainain ..'Ainain is a mountain near the mountain of Uhud, and between it and Uhud there is a valley.. I went out with the people for the battle. When the army aligned for the fight, Siba' came out and said, 'Is there any (Muslim) to accept my challenge to a duel?' Hamza bin `Abdul Muttalib رضی اللہ عنہ came out and said, 'O Siba'. O Ibn Um Anmar, the one who circumcises other ladies! Do you challenge Allah and His Apostle?' Then Hamza attacked and killed him, causing him to be non-extant like the bygone yesterday. I hid myself under a rock, and when he (i.e. Hamza) came near me, I threw my spear at him, driving it into his umbilicus so that it came out through his buttocks, causing him to die. When all the people returned to Mecca, I too returned with them. I stayed in (Mecca) till Islam spread in it (i.e. Mecca). Then I left for Taif, and when the people (of Taif) sent their messengers to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), I was told that the Prophet (ﷺ) did not harm the messengers; So I too went out with them till I reached Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). When he saw me, he said, 'Are you Wahshi?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Was it you who killed Hamza?' I replied, 'What happened is what you have been told of.' He said, 'Can you hide your face from me?' So I went out when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) died, and Musailamah Al-Kadhdhab appeared (claiming to be a prophet). I said, 'I will go out to Musailamah so that I may kill him, and make amends for killing Hamza رضی اللہ عنہ . So I went out with the people (to fight Musailamah and his followers) and then famous events took place concerning that battle. Suddenly I saw a man (i.e. Musailamah) standing near a gap in a wall. He looked like an ash-colored camel and his hair was dishevelled. So I threw my spear at him, driving it into his chest in between his breasts till it passed out through his shoulders, and then an Ansari man attacked him and struck him on the head with a sword. `Abdullah bin `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, 'A slave girl on the roof of a house said: Alas! The chief of the believers (i.e. Musailamah) has been killed by a black slave.""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

When Fatima رضی اللہ عنہا saw that the water aggravated the bleeding, she took a piece of a mat, burnt it, and inserted its ashes into the wound so that the blood was congealed (and bleeding stopped).

He ordered them to be buried with their blood (on their bodies). Neither was the funeral prayer offered for them, nor were they washed. Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ added, ""When my father was martyred, I started weeping and uncovering his face. The companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) stopped me from doing so but the Prophet (ﷺ) did not stop me.

He did not leave behind except a sheet of striped woolen cloth. If we covered his head with it, his feet became naked, and if we covered his feet with it, his head became naked. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to us, ""Cover his head with it and put Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass) over his feet,"" or said, ""Put some Idhkhir over his feet.""

4086,Narrated Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) sent a Sariya of spies and appointed `Asim bin Thabit رضی اللہ عنہ +, the grandfather of `Asim bin `Umar bin Al-Khattab, as their leader. So they set out, and when they reached (a place) between 'Usfan and Mecca, they were mentioned to one of the branch tribes of Bani Hudhail called Lihyan. So, about one-hundred archers followed their traces till they (i.e. the archers) came to a journey station where they (i.e. `Asim and his companions) had encamped and found stones of dates they had brought as journey food from Medina. The archers said, ""These are the dates of Medina,"" and followed their traces till they took them over. When `Asim and his companions were not able to go ahead, they went up a high place, and their pursuers encircled them and said, ""You have a covenant and a promise that if you come down to us, we will not kill anyone of you."" `Asim said, ""As for me, I will never come down on the security of an infidel. O Allah! Inform Your Prophet about us."" So they fought with them till they killed `Asim along with seven of his companions with arrows, and there remained Khubaib رضی اللہ عنہ , Zaid and another man to whom they gave a promise and a covenant. So when the infidels gave them the covenant and promise, they came down. When they captured them, they opened the strings of their arrow bows and tied them with it. The third man who was with them said, ""This is the first breach in the covenant,"" and refused to accompany them. They dragged him and tried to make him accompany them, but he refused, and they killed him. Then they proceeded on taking Khubaib and Zaid till they sold them in Mecca. The sons of Al-Harith bin `Amr bin Naufal bought Khubaib. It was Khubaib who had killed Al-Harith bin `Amr on the day of Badr. Khubaib stayed with them for a while as a captive till they decided unanimously to kill him. (At that time) Khubaib borrowed a razor from one of the daughters of Al- Harith to shave his pubic hair. She gave it to him. She said later on, ""I was heedless of a little baby of mine, who moved towards Khubaib, and when it reached him, he put it on his thigh. When I saw it, I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed my distress while he was carrying the razor in his hand. He said 'Are you afraid that I will kill it? Allah willing, I will never do that,' "" Later on she used to say, ""I have never seen a captive better than Khubaib Once I saw him eating from a bunch of grapes although at that time no fruits were available at Mecca, and he was fettered with iron chains, and in fact, it was nothing but food bestowed upon him by Allah."" So they took him out of the Sanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him. He said, ""Allow me to offer a two-rak`at prayer."" Then he went to them and said, ""Had I not been afraid that you would think I was afraid of death, I would have prayed for a longer time."" So it was Khubaib who first set the tradition of praying two rak`at before being executed. He then said, ""O Allah! Count them one by one,"" and added, 'When I am being martyred as a Muslim, I do not care in what way I receive my death for Allah's Sake, because this death is in Allah's Cause. If He wishes, He will bless the cut limbs."" Then `Uqba bin Al-Harith got up and martyred him. The narrator added: The Quraish (infidels) sent some people to `Asim رضی اللہ عنہ in order to bring a part of his body so that his death might be known for certain, for `Asim رضی اللہ عنہ had killed one of their chiefs on the day of Badr. But Allah sent a cloud of wasps which protected his body from their messengers who could not harm his body consequently.",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

The people (i.e. Al- Qurra) said, 'By Allah, we have not come to harm you, but we are passing by you on our way to do something for the Prophet.' But (the infidels) killed them. The Prophet (ﷺ) therefore invoked evil upon them for a month during the morning prayer. That was the beginning of Al Qunut and we used not to say Qunut before that."" A man asked Anas about Al-Qunut, ""Is it to be said after the Bowing (in the prayer) or after finishing the Recitation (i.e. before Bowing)?""
