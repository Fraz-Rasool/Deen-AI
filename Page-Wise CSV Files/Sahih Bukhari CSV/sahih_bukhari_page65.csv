"1669, 1670",Narrated Usama bin Zaid رضی اللہ عنہما :,"I rode behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) from `Arafat and when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) reached the mountain pass on the left side which is before Al-Muzdalifa he made his camel kneel and then urinated, and then I poured water for his ablution. He performed light ablution and then I said to him: (Is it the time for) the prayer, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!"" He replied, ""The (place of) prayer is ahead of you (i.e. at Al-Muzdalifa)."" So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) rode till he reached Al-Muzdalifa and then he offered the prayer (there) . Then in the morning (10th Dhul-Hijja) Al-Faql (bin `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما ) rode behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Kuraib, (a sub-narrator) said that `Abdullah bin `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما narrated from Al-Fadl رضی اللہ عنہ , ""Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept on reciting Talbiya (during the journey) till he reached the Jamra."" (Jamrat-Al-`Aqaba)",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1671,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنما :,"I proceeded along with the Prophet (ﷺ) on the day of `Arafat (9th Dhul-Hijja). The Prophet (ﷺ) heard a great hue and cry and the beating of camels behind him. So he beckoned to the people with his lash, ""O people! Be quiet. Hastening is not a sign of righteousness."" أَوْضَعُوا means run briskly, خِلاَلَكُمْ is from التَّخَلُّلِ بَيْنَكُمْ i.e. among you. وَفَجَّرْنَا خِلاَلَهُمَا‏ means بَيْنَهُمَا‏ i.e.,we caused to flow between both of them.",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1672,Narrated Usama bin Zaid رضی اللہ عنہما :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) proceeded from `Arafat and dismounted at the mountainous pass and then urinated and performed a light ablution. I said to him, ""(Shall we offer) the prayer?"" He replied, ""The prayer is ahead of you (i.e. at Al-Muzdalifa)."" When he came to Al-Muzdalifa, he performed a perfect ablution. Then Iqama for the prayer was pronounced and he offered the Maghrib prayer and then every person made his camel kneel at his place; and then Iqama for the prayer was pronounced and he offered the (`Isha') prayer and he did not offer any prayer in between them (i.e. Maghrib and `Isha' prayers).",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1673,Narrated Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما :,The Prophet (ﷺ) offered the Maghrib and `Isha' prayers together at Jam' (i.e. Al-Muzdalifa) with a separate Iqama for each of them and did not offer any optional prayer in between them or after each of them.,Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih

1675,Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin Yazid:,"`Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہ performed the Hajj and we reached Al-Muzdalifa at or about the time of the `Isha' prayer. He ordered a man to pronounce the Adhan and Iqama and then he offered the Maghrib prayer and offered two rak`at after it. Then he asked for his supper and took it, and then, I think, he ordered a man to pronounce the Adhan and Iqama (for the `Isha' prayer). (`Amr, a sub-narrator said: The intervening statement 'I think', was said by the sub-narrator Zuhair) (i.e. not by `Abdur-Rahman). Then `Abdullah offered two rak`at of `Isha' prayer. When the day dawned, `Abdullah said, ""The Prophet never offered any prayer at this hour except this prayer at this time and at this place and on this day."" `Abdullah added, ""These two prayers are shifted from their actual times -- the Maghrib prayer (is offered) when the people reached Al-Muzdalifa and the Fajr (morning) prayer at the early dawn."" `Abdullah added, ""I saw the Prophet (ﷺ) doing that.""",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1676,Narrated Salim:,"`Abdullah bin `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما used to send the weak among his family early to Mina. So they used to depart from Al-Mash'ar Al-Haram (that is Al-Muzdalifa) at night (when the moon had set) and invoke Allah as much as they could, and then they would return (to Mina) before the Imam had started from Al- Muzdalifa to Mina. So some of them would reach Mina at the time of the Fajr prayer and some of them would come later. When they reached Mina they would throw pebbles on the Jamra (Jamrat-Al- `Aqaba) Ibn `Umar used to say, ""Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave the permission to them (weak people) to do so.""",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih

1679,"Narrated `Abdullah, the slave of Asma' reported from Hadrat Asma رضی اللہ عنہما :","During the night of Jam', Asma' got down at Al-Muzdalifa and stood up for (offering) the prayer and offered the prayer for some time and then asked, ""O my son! Has the moon set?"" I replied in the negative and she again prayed for another period and then asked, ""Has the moon set?"" I replied, ""Yes."" So she said that we should set out (for Mina), and we departed and went on till she threw pebbles at the Jamra (Jamrat-Al-`Aqaba) and then she returned to her dwelling place and offered the morning prayer. I asked her, ""O you! I think we have come (to Mina) early in the night."" She replied, ""O my son! Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave permission to the women to do so.""",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih

1681,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"We got down at Al-Muzdalifa and Sauda رضی اللہ عنہا asked the permission of the Prophet (ﷺ) to leave (early) before the rush of the people. She was a slow woman and he gave her permission, so she departed (from Al- Muzdalifa) before the rush of the people. We kept on staying at Al-Muzdalifa till dawn, and set out with the Prophet (ﷺ) but (I suffered so much that) I wished I had taken the permission of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as Sauda رضی اللہ عنہا had done, and that would have been dearer to me than any other happiness.",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1682,Narrated `Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہ :,I never saw the Prophet (ﷺ) offering any prayer not at its stated time except two; he prayed the Maghrib and the `Isha' together and he offered the morning prayer before its usual time.,Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1683,Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin Yazid:,"I went out with `Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہ , to Mecca and when we proceeded to am' he offered the two prayers (the Maghrib and the `Isha') together, making the Adhan and Iqama separately for each prayer. He took his supper in between the two prayers. He offered the Fajr prayer as soon as the day dawned. Some people said, ""The day had dawned (at the time of the prayer),"" and others said, ""The day had not dawned."" `Abdullah then said, ""Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'These two prayers have been shifted from their stated times at this place only (at Al-Muzdalifa); first: The Maghrib and the `Isha'. So the people should not arrive at Al-Muzdalifa till the time of the `Isha' prayer has become due. The second prayer is the morning prayer which is offered at this hour.' "" Then `Abdullah stayed there till it became a bit brighter. He then said, ""If the chief of the believers hastened onwards to Mina just now, then he had indeed followed the Sunna."" I do not know which proceeded the other, his (`Abdullah's) statement or the departure of `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ . `Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہ was reciting Talbiya till he threw pebbles at the Jamrat-Al- `Aqaba on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering) (that is the 10th of Dhul-Hijja).",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1684,Narrated `Amr bin Maimun:,"I saw `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ , offering the Fajr (morning) prayer at Jam'; then he got up and said, ""The pagans did not use to depart (from Jam') till the sun had risen, and they used to say, 'Let the sun shine on Thabir (a mountain).' But the Prophet (ﷺ) contradicted them and departed from Jam' before sunrise.""",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1685,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) made Al-Fadl ride behind him, and Al-Fadl informed that he (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) kept on reciting Talbiya till he did the Rami of the Jamra. (Jamrat-Al-`Aqaba.)",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
"1686, 1687",Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"""Usama bin Zaid rode behind the Prophet (ﷺ) from `Arafat to Al-Muzdalifa; and then from Al-Muzdalifa to Mina, Al-Fadl rode behind him.""

1688,Narrated Abu Jamra:,"I asked Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما about Hajj-at-Tamattu`. He ordered me to perform it. I asked him about the Hadi (sacrifice). He said, ""You have to slaughter a camel, a cow or a sheep, or you may share the Hadi with the others."" It seemed that some people disliked it (Hajj-at-Tamattu`). I slept and dreamt as if a person was announcing: ""Hajj Mabrur and accepted Mut'ah (Hajj-at-Tamattu`)"" I went to Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما and narrated it to him. He said, ""Allah is Greater. (That was) the tradition of Abu Al-Qasim (i.e. Prophet). Narrated Shu`ba that the call in the dream was. ""An accepted `Umra and Hajj-Mabrur. """,Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih

1690,Narrated Anas رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) saw a man driving a Badana. He said, ""Ride on it."" The man replied, ""It is a Badana."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said (again), ""Ride on it.""

1691,Narrated Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما :,"During the last Hajj (Hajj-al-Wada`) of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) he performed `Umra and Hajj. He drove a Hadi along with him from Dhul-Hulaifa. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) started by assuming Ihram for `Umra and Hajj. And the people, too, performed the `Umra and Hajj along with the Prophet. Some of them brought the Hadi and drove it along with them, while the others did not. So, when the Prophet (ﷺ) arrived at Mecca. he said to the people, ""Whoever among you has driven the Hadi, should not finish his Ihram till he completes his Hajj. And whoever among you has not (driven) the Hadi with him, should perform Tawaf of the Ka`ba and the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, then cut short his hair and finish his Ihram, and should later assume Ihram for Hajj; but he must offer a Hadi (sacrifice); and if anyone cannot afford a Hadi, he should fast for three days during the Hajj and seven days when he returns home. The Prophet (ﷺ) performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba on his arrival (at Mecca); he touched the (Black Stone) corner first of all and then did Ramal (fast walking with moving of the shoulders) during the first three rounds round the Ka`ba, and during the last four rounds he walked. After finishing Tawaf of the Ka`ba, he offered a two rak`at prayer at Maqam Ibrahim, and after finishing the prayer he went to Safa and Marwa and performed seven rounds of Tawaf between them and did not do any deed forbidden because of Ihram, till he finished all the ceremonies of his Hajj and sacrificed his Hadi on the day of Nahr (10th day of Dhul-Hijja). He then hastened onwards (to Mecca) and performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba and then everything that was forbidden because of Ihram became permissible. Those who took and drove the Hadi with them did the same as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did.",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1692,Narrated 'Urwa:,""" 'Aishah رضی اللہ عنہا informed me about the Hajj and 'Umra (together) of the Prophet (ﷺ) and so did the people who were with him (during the Hajj and 'Umra) and narration similar to the narration of the Ibn 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہما (previous hadith)",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1693,Narrated `Abdullah (bin `Abdullah) bin `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما :,"""Stay here, for I am afraid that it (affliction between Ibn Zubair and Al-Hajjaj) might prevent you from reaching the Ka`ba."" Ibn `Umar said, ""(In this case) I would do the same as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did, and Allah has said, 'Verily, in Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), you have a good example (to follow).' So, I make you, people, witness that I have made `Umra compulsory for me."" So he assumed lhram for `Umra. Then he went out and when he reached Al- Baida', he assumed Ihram for Hajj and `Umra (together) and said, ""The conditions (requisites) of Hajj and `Umra are the same."" He, then brought a Hadi from Qudaid.

1696,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"I twisted with my own hands the garlands for the Budn of the Prophet (ﷺ) who garlanded and marked them, and then made them proceed to Mecca; Yet no permissible thing was regarded as illegal for him then.",Hajj (Pilgrimage),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
