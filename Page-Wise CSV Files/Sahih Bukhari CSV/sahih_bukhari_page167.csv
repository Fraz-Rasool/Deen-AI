He replied, `Aisha.' I said, 'From amongst the men?' He replied, 'Her father (Abu Bakr)'. I said, 'Whom (do you love) next?' He replied, ""`Umar.'

4359,Narrated Jarir رضی اللہ عنہ :,"While I was at Yemen, I met two men from Yemen called Dhu Kala and Dhu `Amr, and I started telling them about Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Dhu `Amr said to me, ""If what you are saying about your friend (i.e. the Prophet) is true, then he has died three days ago."" Then both of them accompanied me to Medina, and when we had covered some distance on the way to Medina, we saw some riders coming from Medina. We asked them and they said, ""Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has died and Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ has been appointed as the Caliph and the people are in a good state.' Then they said, ""Tell your friend (Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ ) that we have come (to visit him), and if Allah will, we will come again."" So they both returned to Yemen. When I told Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ their statement, he said to me, ""I wish you had brought them (to me)."" Afterwards I met Dhu `Amr, and he said to me, ""O Jarir! You have done a favor to me and I am going to tell you something, i.e. you, the nation of 'Arabs, will remain prosperous as long as you choose and appoint another chief whenever a former one is dead. But if authority is obtained by the power of the sword, then the rulers will become kings who will get angry, as kings get angry, and will be delighted as kings get delighted.""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4360,Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہما :,"""Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent troops to the sea coast and appointed Abu 'Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah رضی اللہ عنہما as their commander, and they were 300 (men). We set out, and we had covered some distance on the way, when our journey food ran short. So Abu 'Ubaida رضی اللہ عنہما ordered that all the food present with the troops be collected, and it was collected. Our journey food was dates, and Abu Ubaida kept on giving us our daily ration from it little by little (piecemeal) till it decreased to such an extent that we did not receive except a date each."" I asked (Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ), ""How could one date benefit you?"" He said, ""We came to know its value when even that finished."" Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ added, ""Then we reached the sea (coast) where we found a fish like a small mountain. The people (i.e. troops) ate of it for 18 nights (i.e. days). Then Abu 'Ubaida رضی اللہ عنہ ordered that two of its ribs be fixed on the ground (in the form of an arch) and that a she-camel be ridden and passed under them. So it passed under them without touching them.""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

We stayed at the seashore for half a month and were struck with such severe hunger that we ate even the Khabt (i.e. the leaves of the Salam, a thorny desert tree), and because of that, the army was known as Jaish-ul-Khabt. Then the sea threw out, an animal (i.e. a fish) called Al-`Anbar and we ate of that for half a month, and rubbed its fat on our bodies till our bodies returned to their original state (i.e. became strong and healthy). Abu Ubaida رضی اللہ عنہ took one of its ribs, fixed it on the ground; then he went to the tallest man of his companions (to let him pass under the rib). Once Sufyan said, ""He took a rib from its parts and fixed it, and then took a man and camel and they passed from underneath it (without touching it). "" Jabir added: There was a man amongst the people who slaughtered three camels and then slaughtered another three camels and then slaughtered other three camels, and then Abu 'Ubaida forbade him to do so. Narrated Abu Salih: Qais bin Sa`d رضی اللہ عنہ said to his father. ""I was present in the army and the people were struck with severe hunger."" He said, ""You should have slaughtered (camels) (for them)."" Qais رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I did slaughter camels but they were hungry again. He said, ""You should have slaughtered (camels) again."" Qais رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I did slaughter (camels) again but the people felt hungry again."" He said, ""You should have slaughtered (camels) again.""

Abu Ubaida رضی اللہ عنہ took (and fixed) one of its bones and a rider passed underneath it (without touching it). (Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ added:) Abu 'Ubaida رضی اللہ عنہ said (to us), ""Eat (of that fish).""

She said, 'Ask Um Salama رضی اللہ عنہا .' So, I informed them (of `Aisha's answer) and they sent me to Um Salama رضی اللہ عنہا for the same purpose as they sent me to `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا . Um Salama رضی اللہ عنہا replied, 'I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) forbidding the offering of these two rak`at. Once the Prophet (ﷺ) offered the `Asr prayer, and then came to me.

Then (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) offered those two rak`at, and I sent my (lady) servant to him, saying, 'Stand beside him and say (to him): Um Salama رضی اللہ عنہا says, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Didn't I hear you forbidding the offering of these two rak`at (after the `Asr prayer yet I see you offering them?' And if he beckons to you with his hand, then wait behind.' So the lady slave did that and the Prophet (ﷺ) beckoned her with his hand, and she stayed behind, and when the Prophet (ﷺ) finished his prayer, he said, 'O the daughter of Abu Umaiya رضی اللہ عنہا(i.e. Um Salama), You were asking me about these two rak`at after the `Asr prayer. In fact, some people from the tribe of `Abdul Qais came to me to embrace Islam and busied me so much that I did not offer the two rak`at which were offered after Zuhr compulsory prayer, and these two rak`at (you have seen me offering) make up for those.""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

If you should kill me, you would kill a person who has already killed somebody, and if you should set me free, you would do a favor to one who is grateful, and if you want property, then ask me whatever wealth you want."" He was left till the next day when the Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, ""What have you got, Thumama? He said, ""What I told you, i.e. if you set me free, you would do a favor to one who is grateful."" The Prophet (ﷺ) left him till the day after, when he said, ""What have you got, O Thumama?"" He said, ""I have got what I told you. ""On that the Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Release Thumama."" So he (i.e. Thumama) went to a garden of date-palm trees near to the Mosque, took a bath and then entered the Mosque and said, ""I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and also testify that Muhammad is His Apostle! By Allah, O Muhammad! There was no face on the surface of the earth most disliked by me than yours, but now your face has become the most beloved face to me. By Allah, there was no religion most disliked by me than yours, but now it is the most beloved religion to me. By Allah, there was no town most disliked by me than your town, but now it is the most beloved town to me. Your cavalry arrested me (at the time) when I was intending to perform the `Umra. And now what do you think?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) gave him good tidings (congratulated him) and ordered him to perform the `Umra. So when he came to Mecca, someone said to him, ""You have become a Sabian?"" Thumama replied, ""No! By Allah, I have embraced Islam with Muhammad, Apostle of Allah. No, by Allah!

And I think you are the same person who was shown to me in my dream, and this is Thabit bin Qais who will answer your questions on my behalf."" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) went away from him.
