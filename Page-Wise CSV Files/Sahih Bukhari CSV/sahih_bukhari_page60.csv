The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me, ""This `Umra is instead of your missed one."" Those who had assumed Ihram for `Umra (Hajj-atTamattu) performed Tawaf round the Ka`ba and between Safa and Marwa and then finished their Ihram.

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and some of his companions were resourceful and had the Hadi with them, they could not perform Umra (alone) (but had to perform both Hajj and Umra with one Ihram). Aisha added, ""Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me and saw me weeping and said, ""What makes you weep, O Hantah?"" I replied, ""I have heard your conversation with your companions and I cannot perform the Umra."" He asked, ""What is wrong with you?' I replied, ' I do not offer the prayers (i.e. I have my menses).' He said, ' It will not harm you for you are one of the daughters of Adam, and Allah has written for you (this state) as He has written it for them. Keep on with your intentions for Hajj and Allah may reward you that."" Aisha further added, ""Then we proceeded for Hajj till we reached Mina and I became clean from my menses.

So the people who had not driven the Hadi along with them finished their Ihram. The Prophet's wives, too, had not driven the Hadi with them, so they too, finished their Ihram."" `Aisha added, ""I got my menses and could not perform Tawaf round the Ka`ba."" So when it was the night of Hasba (i.e. when we stopped at Al-Muhassab), I said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Everyone is returning after performing Hajj and `Umra but I am returning after performing Hajj only.' He said, 'Didn't you perform Tawaf round the Ka`ba the night we reached Mecca?' I replied in the negative. He said, 'Go with your brother to Tan`im and assume the Ihram for `Umra, (and after performing it) come back to such and such a place.' On that Safiya said, 'I feel that I will detain you all.' The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'O 'Aqra Halqa! Didn't you perform Tawaf of the Ka`ba on the day of sacrifice?
