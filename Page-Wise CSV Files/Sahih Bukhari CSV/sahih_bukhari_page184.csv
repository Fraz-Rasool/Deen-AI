4799,Narrated Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""Moses was a shy man, and that is what the Statement of Allah means: 'O you who believe Be not like those who annoyed Moses, but Allah proved his innocence of that which they alleged and he was honorable in Allah's Sight.'

4800,Narrated Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Allah's Prophet said, ""When Allah decrees some order in the heaven, the angels flutter their wings indicating complete surrender to His saying which sounds like chains being dragged on rock. And when the state of fear disappears, they ask each other, ""What has your Lord ordered? They say that He has said that which is true and just, and He is the Most High, the Most Great."" (34.23). Then the stealthy listeners (devils) hear this order, and these stealthy listeners are like this, one over the other."" (Sufyan, a sub-narrator demonstrated that by holding his hand upright and separating the fingers.) A stealthy listener hears a word which he will convey to that which is below him and the second will convey it to that which is below him till the last of them will convey it to the wizard or foreteller. Sometimes a flame (fire) may strike the devil before he can convey it, and sometimes he may convey it before the flame (fire) strikes him, whereupon the wizard adds to that word a hundred lies. The people will then say, 'Didn't he (i.e. magician) tell such-and-such a thing on such-and-such date?' So that magician is said to have told the truth because of the Statement which has been heard from the heavens.""",Prophetic Commentary on the Qur'an (Tafseer of the Prophet (PBUH)),Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih

He said, ""Don't you recite:--'And among his progeny, David and Solomon..(6.84). Those are they whom Allah had guided. So follow their guidance.'

4809,Narrated Masruq:,"We came upon `Abdullah bin Mas`ud رضی اللہ عنہ and he said ""O people! If somebody knows something, he can say it, but if he does not know it, he should say, ""Allah knows better,' for it is a sign of having knowledge to say about something which one does not know, 'Allah knows better.' Allah said to His Prophet: 'Say (O Muhammad ! ) No wage do I ask of You for this (Qur'an) nor am I one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist).' (38.86) Now I will tell you about Ad- Dukhan (the smoke), Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) invited the Quraish to embrace Islam, but they delayed their response. So he said, ""O Allah! Help me against them by sending on them seven years of famine similar to the seven years of famine of Joseph."" So the famine year overtook them and everything was destroyed till they ate dead animals and skins. People started imagining to see smoke between them and the sky because of severe hunger. Allah said: 'Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible, covering the people. . . This is painful torment.' (44.10-11) (So they invoked Allah) ""Our Lord! Remove the punishment from us really we are believers."" How can there be an (effectual) reminder for them when an Apostle, explaining things clearly, has already come to them? Then they had turned away from him and said: 'One taught (by a human being), a madman?' 'We shall indeed remove punishment for a while, but truly, you will revert (to disbelief).' (44.12-15) Will the punishment be removed on the Day of Resurrection?"" `Abdullah added, ""The punishment was removed from them for a while but they reverted to disbelief, so Allah destroyed them on the Day of Badr.

4810,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"Some pagans who committed murders in great number and committed illegal sexual intercourse excessively, came to Muhammad and said, ""O Muhammad! Whatever you say and invite people to, is good: but we wish if you could inform us whether we can make an expiration for our (past evil) deeds."" So the Divine Verses came: 'Those who invoke not with Allah any other god, not kill such life as Allah has forbidden except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse.' (25.68) And there was also revealed:-- 'Say: O My slaves who have transgressed against their souls! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah.'

We learn that Allah will put all the heavens on one finger, and the earths on one finger, and the trees on one finger, and the water and the dust on one finger, and all the other created beings on one finger. Then He will say, 'I am the King.' Thereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) smiled so that his pre-molar teeth became visible, and that was the confirmation of the Rabbi. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) recited: 'They made not a just estimate of Allah such as is due to Him. And on the Day of Resurrection the whole of the earth will be grasped by His Hand and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. Glorified is He, and High is He above all that they associate as partners with Him.' (39.67)",Prophetic Commentary on the Qur'an (Tafseer of the Prophet (PBUH)),Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih

(42.23) Sa`id bin Zubair (who was present then) said, ""It means here (to show what is due for) the relatives of Muhammad."" On that Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما said: you have hurried in giving the answer! There was no branch of the tribe of Quraish but the Prophet (ﷺ) had relatives therein.

4821,Narrated `Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہ :,"It (i.e., the imagined smoke) was because, when the Quraish refused to obey the Prophet, he asked Allah to afflict them with years of famine similar to those of (Prophet) Joseph. So they were stricken with famine and fatigue, so much so that they ate even bones. A man would look towards the sky and imagine seeing something like smoke between him and the sky because of extreme fatigue.

Help me against them by afflicting them with seven years of famine like the seven years of Joseph.""

Then they said: Our Lord! Remove the torment from us, really we are believers. (44.12) And then it was said to the Prophet (by Allah), ""If we remove it from them. they will revert to their ways (of heathenism)."" So the Prophet (ﷺ) invoked his Lord, who removed the punishment from them, but later they reverted (to heathenism), whereupon Allah punished them on the day of the Battle of Badr, and that is what Allah's Statement indicates: 'Then watch for the day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible...we will indeed (then) exact retribution.'
