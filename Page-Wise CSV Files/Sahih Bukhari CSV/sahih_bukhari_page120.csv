So, the prophet carried out the expedition and when he reached that town at the time or nearly at the time of the `Asr prayer, he said to the sun, 'O sun! You are under Allah's Order and I am under Allah's Order O Allah! Stop it (i.e. the sun) from setting.' It was stopped till Allah made him victorious. Then he collected the booty and the fire came to burn it, but it did not burn it. He said (to his men), 'Some of you have stolen something from the booty. So one man from every tribe should give me a pledge of allegiance by shaking hands with me.' (They did so and) the hand of a man got stuck over the hand of their prophet. Then that prophet said (to the man), 'The theft has been committed by your people. So all the persons of your tribe should give me the pledge of allegiance by shaking hands with me.' The hands of two or three men got stuck over the hand of their prophet and he said, ""You have committed the theft.' Then they brought a head of gold like the head of a cow and put it there, and the fire came and consumed the booty. The Prophet (ﷺ) added: Then Allah saw our weakness and disability, so he made booty legal for us.""",One-fifth of Booty to the Cause of Allah (Khumus),Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih

3129,Narrated `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہما :,"When Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ got up during the battle of Al-Jamal, he called me and I stood up beside him, and he said to me, ""O my son! Today one will be killed either as an oppressor or as an oppressed one. I see that I will be killed as an oppressed one. My biggest worry is my debts. Do you think, if we pay the debts, there will be something left for us from our money?"" Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ added, ""O my son! Sell our property and pay my debts."" Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ then willed one-third of his property and willed one-third of that portion to his sons; namely, `Abdullah's sons. He said, ""One-third of the one third. If any property is left after the payment of the debts, one-third (of the one-third of what is left) is to be given to your sons."" (Hisham, a sub-narrator added, ""Some of the sons of `Abdullah were equal in age to the sons of Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ e.g. Khubaib and `Abbas. `Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہ had nine sons and nine daughters at that time."" (The narrator `Abdullah added:) My father (Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ) went on drawing my attention to his debts saying, ""If you should fail to pay part of the debts, appeal to my Master to help you."" By Allah! I could not understand what he meant till I asked, ""O father! Who is your Master?"" He replied, ""Allah (is my Master)."" By Allah, whenever I had any difficulty regarding his debts, I would say, ""Master of Az-Zubair! Pay his debts on his behalf ."" and Allah would (help me to) pay it. Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ was martyred leaving no Dinar or Dirham but two pieces of land, one of which was (called) Al-Ghaba, and eleven houses in Medina, two in Basra, one in Kufa and one in Egypt. In fact, the source of the debt which he owed was, that if somebody brought some money to deposit with him. Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ would say, ""No, (i won't keep it as a trust), but I take it as a debt, for I am afraid it might be lost."" Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ was never appointed governor or collector of the tax of Kharaj or any other similar thing, but he collected his wealth (from the war booty he gained) during the holy battles he took part in, in the company of the Prophet, Abu Bakr, `Umar, and `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہما . (`Abdullah bin Az-Zubair added:) When I counted his debt, it turned to be two million and two hundred thousand. (The sub-narrator added:) Hakim bin Hizam رضی اللہ عنہ met `Abdullah bin Zubair and asked, ""O my nephew! How much is the debt of my brother?"" `Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہا kept it as a secret and said, ""One hundred thousand,"" Hakim said, ""By Allah! I don't think your property will cover it."" On that `Abdullah said to him, ""What if it is two million and two hundred thousand?"" Hakim said, ""I don't think you can pay it; so if you are unable to pay all of it, I will help you."" Az- Zubair had already bought Al-Ghaba for one hundred and seventy thousand. `Abdullah sold it for one million and six hundred thousand. Then he called the people saying, ""Any person who has any money claim on Az-Zubair should come to us in Al-Ghaba."" There came to him `Abdullah bin Ja`far whom Az-Zubair owed four hundred thousand. He said to `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair, ""If you wish I will forgive you the debt."" `Abdullah (bin Az-Zubair) said, ""No."" Then Ibn Ja`far said, ""If you wish you can defer the payment if you should defer the payment of any debt."" Ibn Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""No."" `Abdullah bin Ja`far said, ""Give me a piece of the land."" `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ said (to him), ""Yours is the land extending from this place to this place."" So, `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ sold some of the property (including the houses) and paid his debt perfectly, retaining four and a half shares from the land (i.e. Al-Ghaba). He then went to Mu'awlya while `Amr bin `Uthman, Al-Mundhir bin Az- Zubair and Ibn Zam`a were sitting with him. Mu'awiya رضی اللہ عنہ asked, ""At what price have you appraised Al- Ghaba?"" He said, ""One hundred thousand for each share,"" Muawiya رضی اللہ عنہ asked, ""How many shares have been left?"" `Abdullah replied, ""Four and a half shares."" Al-Mundhir bin Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand."" `Amr bin `Uthman said, ""I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand."" Ibn Zam`a said, ""I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand."" Muawiya رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""How much is left now?"" `Abdullah replied, ""One share and a half."" Muawiya رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I would like to buy it for one hundred and fifty thousand."" `Abdullah also sold his part to Muawiya رضی اللہ عنہ six hundred thousand. When Ibn Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ had paid all the debts. Az-Zubair's sons said to him, ""Distribute our inheritance among us."" He said, ""No, by Allah, I will not distribute it among you till I announce in four successive Hajj seasons, 'Would those who have money claims on Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ come so that we may pay them their debt."" So, he started to announce that in public in every Hajj season, and when four years had elapsed, he distributed the inheritance among the inheritors. Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ had four wives, and after the one-third of his property was excluded (according to the will), each of his wives received one million and two hundred thousand. So the total amount of his property was fifty million and two hundred thousand.",One-fifth of Booty to the Cause of Allah (Khumus),Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih
3130,Narrated Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما :,"`Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ did not join the Badr battle because he was married to one of the daughters of Allah's Apostle and she was ill. So, the Prophet (ﷺ) said to him. ""You will get a reward and a share (from the war booty) similar to the reward and the share of one who has taken part in the Badr battle.""",One-fifth of Booty to the Cause of Allah (Khumus),Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih
"3131, 3132",Narrated Marwan bin Al-Hakim and Miswar bin Makhrama رضی اللہ عنہ :,"When the Hawazin delegation came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) after they had embraced Islam and requested him to return their properties and war prisoners to them, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""To me the best talk is the truest, so you may choose either of two things; the war prisoners or the wealth, for I have delayed their distribution."" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had waited for them for over ten days when he returned from Ta'if. So, when those people came to know that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was not going to return to them except one of the two things the said, ""We choose our war Prisoners 'Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood up amongst the Muslims, and after glorifying Allah as He deserved, he said, ""Now then, these brothers of yours have come to us with repentance, and I see it logical that I should return their captives to them, so whoever of you likes to do that as a favor then he can do it, and whoever amongst you likes to stick to his share, let him give up his prisoners and we will compensate him from the very first Fai' (i.e. war booty received without fight) which Allah will give us."" On that, all the people said. 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)s We have agreed willingly to do so (return the captives)"" Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to them ""I do not know who amongst you has agreed to this and who has not. You should return and let your leaders inform me of your agreement."" The people returned and their leaders spoke to them, and then came to Allah's Apostle and said, ""All the people have agreed willingly to do so and have given the permission to return the war prisoners (without Compensation)"" (Az-Zuhri, the sub-narrator states) This is what has been related to us about the captives of Hawazin.",One-fifth of Booty to the Cause of Allah (Khumus),Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih
3133,Narrated Zahdam:,"Once we were in the house of Abu Musa رضی اللہ عنہ who presented a meal containing cooked chicken. A man from the tribe of Bani Taim Allah with red complexion as if he were from the Byzantine war prisoners, was present. Abu Musa رضی اللہ عنہ invited him to share the meal but he (apologised) saying. ""I saw chickens eating dirty things and so I have had a strong aversion to eating them, and have taken an oath that I will not eat chickens."" Abu Musa رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Come along, I will tell you about this matter (i.e. how to cancel one's oath). I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) in the company of a group of Al-Ashariyin, asked him to provide us with means of conveyance. He said, 'By Allah, I will not provide you with any means of conveyance and I have nothing to make you ride on.' Then some camels as booty were brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he asked for us saying. 'Where are the group of Al-Ash`ariyun?' Then he ordered that we should be given five camels with white humps. When we set out we said, 'What have we done? We will never be blessed (with what we have been given).' So, we returned to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, 'We asked you to provide us with means of conveyance, but you took an oath that you would not provide us with any means of conveyance. Did you forget (your oath when you gave us the camels)? He replied. 'I have not provided you with means of conveyance, but Allah has provided you with it, and by Allah, Allah willing, if ever I take an oath to do something, and later on I find that it is more beneficial to do something different, I will do the thing which is better, and give expiation for my oath.""",One-fifth of Booty to the Cause of Allah (Khumus),Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih

We were over fifty (or fifty-three or fifty two) men from our people.

So, I went to him and said, ""Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had promised to give me so much an so much."" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ scooped up money with both hands thrice for me.""
