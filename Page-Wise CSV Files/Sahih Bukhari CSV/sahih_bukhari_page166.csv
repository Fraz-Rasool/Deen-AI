4330,Narrated `Abdullah bin Zaid bin `Asim رضی اللہ عنہ :,"When Allah gave to His Apostle the war booty on the day of Hunain, he distributed that booty amongst those whose hearts have been (recently) reconciled (to Islam), but did not give anything to the Ansar. So they seemed to have felt angry and sad as they did not get the same as other people had got. The Prophet (ﷺ) then delivered a sermon before them, saying, ""O, the assembly of Ansar! Didn't I find you astray, and then Allah guided you on the Right Path through me? You were divided into groups, and Allah brought you together through me; you were poor and Allah made you rich through me."" Whatever the Prophet (ﷺ) said , they (i.e. the Ansar) said, ""Allah and his Apostle have more favours to do."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""What stops you from answering the Messenger of Allah?"" But whatever he said to them, they replied, ""Allah and His Apostle have more favours to do."" The Prophet (ﷺ) then said, ""If you wish you could say: 'You came to us in such-and-such state (at Medina).' Wouldn't you be willing to see the people go away with sheep and camels while you go with the Prophet (ﷺ) to your homes? But for the migration, I would have been one of the Ansar, and if the people took their way through a valley or mountain pass, I would select the valley or mountain pass of the Ansar. The Ansar are Shiar (i.e. those clothes which are in direct contact with the body and worn inside the other garments), and the people are Dithar (i.e. those clothes which are not in direct contact with the body and are worn over other garments). No doubt, you will see other people favoured over you, so you should be patient till you meet me at the Tank (of Kauthar).",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4331,Narrated Anas Bin Malik رضی اللہ عنہ :,"When Allah gave Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) what he gave of the properties of the Hawazin tribe as a war booty, the Prophet (ﷺ) started giving some men 100 camels each. The Ansar (then) said, ""May Allah forgive Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)s as he gives to Quraish and leaves us although our swords are still dribbling with the blood of Quraish."" Allah Apostle was informed of their statement, so he sent for the Ansar and gathered them in a leather tent, and did not call anybody else along with them. When they al I gathered, the Prophet (ﷺ) got up and said, ""What is this talk being informed to me about you?"" The learned men amongst the Ansar said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Our chiefs did not say anything, but some people amongst us who are younger in age said. 'May Allah forgive Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as he gives (of the booty) to Quraish and leaves us though our swords are still dribbling with their blood."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""I give to these men who have newly deserted heathenism (and embraced Islam) so as to attract their hearts. Won't you be happy that the people take the wealth while you take the Prophet (ﷺ) with you to your homes? By Allah, what you are taking is better than whatever they are taking."" They (i.e. the Ansar) said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We are satisfied."" The Prophet (ﷺ) then said to them. ""You will find others favored over you greatly, so be patient till you meet Allah and His Apostle and I will be at the Tank then.""
