I will tell you why: As for the tooth, it is a bone; and as for the nail, it is the knife of Ethiopians."" The quick ones among the people got the war booty while the Prophet (ﷺ) was behind the people. So they placed the cooking pots on the fire, but the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered the cooking pots to be turned upside down. Then he distributed (the war booty) among them, considering one camel as equal to ten sheep. Then a camel belonging to the first party of people ran away and they had no horses with them, so a man shot it with an arrow whereby Allah stopped it.

I said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Sometimes when we are in battles or on a journey we want to slaughter (animals) but we have no knives."" He said, ""Listen! If you slaughter the animal with anything that causes its blood to flow out, and if Allah's Name is mentioned on slaughtering it, eat of it, provided that the slaughtering instrument is not a tooth or a nail, as the tooth is a bone and the nail is the knife of Ethiopians.""","Hunting, Slaughtering",Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih
