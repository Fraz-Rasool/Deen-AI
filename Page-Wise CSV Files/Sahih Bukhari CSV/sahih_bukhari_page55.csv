Many people came to me as if they had not seen me before. So I told this to `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ who said to me, ""You may depart and live nearby if you wish."" That was the reason for my being here for even if an Ethiopian had been nominated as my ruler, I would have obeyed him .",Obligatory Charity Tax (Zakat),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
