So I carried it with him and my father followed us so as to take the price (of the saddle). My father said, ""O Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ ! Tell me what happened to you on your night journey with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (during Migration)."" He said, ""Yes, we travelled the whole night and also the next day till midday. when nobody could be seen on the way ( because of the severe heat) . Then there appeared a long rock having shade beneath it, and the sunshine had not come to it yet. So we dismounted there and I levelled a place and covered it with an animal hide or dry grass for the Prophet (ﷺ) to sleep on (for a while). I then said, 'Sleep, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and I will guard you.' So he slept and I went out to guard him. Suddenly I saw a shepherd coming with his sheep to that rock with the same intention we had when we came to it. I asked (him). 'To whom do you belong, O boy?' He replied, 'I belong to a man from Medina or Mecca.' I said, 'Do your sheep have milk?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Will you milk for us?' He said, 'Yes.' He caught hold of a sheep and I asked him to clean its teat from dust, hairs and dirt. (The sub-narrator said that he saw Al-Bara' striking one of his hands with the other, demonstrating how the shepherd removed the dust.) The shepherd milked a little milk in a wooden container and I had a leather container which I carried for the Prophet (ﷺ) to drink and perform the ablution from. I went to the Prophet, hating to wake him up, but when I reached there, the Prophet (ﷺ) had already awakened; so I poured water over the middle part of the milk container, till the milk was cold. Then I said, 'Drink, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!' He drank till I was pleased. Then he asked, 'Has the time for our departure come?' I said, 'Yes.' So we departed after midday. Suraqa bin Malik followed us and I said, 'We have been discovered, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!' He said, Don't grieve for Allah is with us.' The Prophet (ﷺ) invoked evil on him (i.e. Suraqa) and so the legs of his horse sank into the earth up to its belly. (The subnarrator, Zuhair is not sure whether Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""(It sank) into solid earth."") Suraqa said, 'I see that you have invoked evil on me. Please invoke good on me, and by Allah, I will cause those who are seeking after you to return.' The Prophet (ﷺ) invoked good on him and he was saved. Then, whenever he met somebody on the way, he would say, 'I have looked for him here in vain.' So he caused whomever he met to return. Thus Suraqa fulfilled his promise.""",Virtues and Merits of the Prophet (PBUH) and his Companions,Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih
3616,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) paid a visit to a sick bedouin. The Prophet (ﷺ) when visiting a patient used to say, ""No harm will befall you! May Allah cure you! May Allah cure you!"" So the Prophet (ﷺ) said to the bedouin. ""No harm will befall you. May Allah cure you!"" The bedouin said, ""You say, may Allah cure me? No, for it is a fever which boils in (the body of) an old man, and will lead him to the grave."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Yes, then may it be as you say.""",Virtues and Merits of the Prophet (PBUH) and his Companions,Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih
3617,Narrated Anas رضی اللہ عنہ :,"There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read Surat-al-Baqara and Al-`Imran, and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet. Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: ""Muhammad knows nothing but what I have written for him."" Then Allah caused him to die, and the people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, ""This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them."" They again dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, ""This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them."" They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground).",Virtues and Merits of the Prophet (PBUH) and his Companions,Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih
