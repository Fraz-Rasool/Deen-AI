7096,Narrated Hudhaifa رضی اللہ عنہ :,"""While we were sitting with `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ , he said, 'Who among you remembers the statement of the Prophet (ﷺ) about the afflictions?' Hudhaifa رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""The affliction of a man in his family, his property, his children and his neighbors are expiated by his prayers, Zakat (and alms) and enjoining good and forbidding evil."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I do not ask you about these afflictions, but about those afflictions which will move like the waves of the sea."" Hudhaifa رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Don't worry about it, O chief of the believers, for there is a closed door between you and them."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Will that door be broken or opened?"" I said, ""No. it will be broken."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Then it will never be closed,"" I said, ""Yes."" We asked Hudhaifa, ""Did `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ know what that door meant?"" He replied, ""Yes, as I know that there will be night before tomorrow morning, that is because I narrated to him a true narration free from errors."" We dared not ask Hudhaifa رضی اللہ عنہ as to whom the door represented so we ordered Masruq to ask him what does the door stand for? He replied, ""`Umar رضی اللہ عنہ .""",Afflictions and the End of the World,Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih
7097,Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) went out to one of the gardens of Medina for some business and I went out to follow him. When he entered the garden, I sat at its gate and said to myself, ""To day I will be the gatekeeper of the Prophet though he has not ordered me."" The Prophet (ﷺ) went and finished his need and went to sit on the constructed edge of the well and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. In the meantime Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ came and asked permission to enter. I said (to him), ""Wait till I get you permission."" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ waited outside and I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, ""O Allah's Prophet! Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ asks your permission to enter."" He said, ""Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise."" So Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ entered and sat on the right side of the Prophet (ﷺ) and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. Then `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ came and I said (to him), ""Wait till I get you permission."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise."" So `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ entered and sat on the left side of the Prophet and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well so that one side of the well became fully occupied and there remained no place for any-one to sit. Then `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ came and I said (to him), ""Wait till I get permission for you."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise with a calamity which will befall him."" When he entered, he could not find any place to sit with them so he went to the other edge of the well opposite them and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. I wished that a brother of mine would come, so I invoked Allah for his coming. (Ibn Al-Musaiyab said, ""I interpreted that (narration) as indicating their graves. The first three are together and the grave of `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ is separate from theirs."")",Afflictions and the End of the World,Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih
7098,Narrated Abu Wail:,"Someone said to Usama رضی اللہ عنہ , ""Will you not talk to this (Uthman)?"" Usama رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I talked to him (secretly) without being the first man to open an evil door. I will never tell a ruler who rules over two men or more that he is good after I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, 'A man will be brought and put in Hell (Fire) and he will circumambulate (go around and round) in Hell (Fire) like a donkey of a (flour) grinding mill, and all the people of Hell (Fire) will gather around him and will say to him, O so-and-so! Didn't you use to order others for good and forbid them from evil?' That man will say, 'I used to order others to do good but I myself never used to do it, and I used to forbid others from evil while I myself used to do evil.'
