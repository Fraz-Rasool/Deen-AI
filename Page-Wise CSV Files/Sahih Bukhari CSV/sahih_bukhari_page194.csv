5052,Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al `As رضی اللہ عنہ :,"My father got me married to a lady of a noble family, and often used to ask my wife about me, and she used to reply, ""What a wonderful man he is! He never comes to my bed, nor has he approached me since he married me."" When this state continued for a long period, my father told the story to the Prophet who said to my father, ""Let me meet him."" Then I met him and he asked me, ""How do you fast?"" I replied, ""I fast daily,"" He asked, ""How long does it take you to finish the recitation of the whole Qur'an?"" I replied, ""I finish it every night."" On that he said, ""Fast for three days every month and recite the Qur'an (and finish it) in one month."" I said, ""But I have power to do more than that."" He said, ""Then fast for three days per week."" I said, ""i have the power to do more than that."" He said, ""Therefore, fast the most superior type of fasting, (that is, the fasting of (prophet) David who used to fast every alternate day; and finish the recitation of the whole Qur'an In seven days."" I wish I had accepted the permission of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as I have become a weak old man. It is said that `Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہما used to recite one-seventh of the Qur'an during the day-time to some of his family members, for he used to check his memorization of what he would recite at night during the daytime so that it would be easier for him to read at night. And whenever he wanted to gain some strength, he used to give up fasting for some days and count those days to fast for a similar period, for he disliked to leave those things which he used to do during the lifetime of the Prophet. Imam Bukhari says: Some people said to finish the Quran within three days, some said within five day and most of them said within seven days.",Virtues of the Qur'an,Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih

5055,Narrated `Abdullah (bin Mas`ud) رضی اللہ عنہما :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said (to me), ""Recite the Qur'an to me."" I said, ""Shall I recite (it) to you while it has been revealed to you?"" He said, ""I like to hear it from another person."" So I recited Surat An-Nisa (The Women) till I reached the Verse: 'How (will it be) then when We bring from each nation a witness, and We bring you (O Muhammad) as a witness against these people.'

5059,Narrated Abu Musa رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""The example of a believer who recites the Qur'an and acts on it, like a citron which tastes nice and smells nice. And the example of a believer who does not recite the Qur'an but acts on it, is like a date which tastes good but has no smell.

Harith bin Obaid and Saeed bin Zaid have reported similarly from Abu Imran. Hamad bin Salamah and Aban did not report it tracing it to the prophet ﷺ. Ghunder, Shobah, Abu Imran has reported Hadrat Jundab's saying. Ibn-e-Aun, Abu Imran has reported Hadrat Judab's saying. Ibn-e-Aun, Abu Imran, Abdullah bin Samit report Hadrat Umer's saying but the narration of Hadrat Jundab is more authentic and more famous.",Virtues of the Qur'an,Sahih Bukhari,6,Sahih
5062,Narrated `Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہما :,"He heard a man reciting a Quranic Verse which he had heard the Prophet (ﷺ) reciting in a different way.

Then one of them said, ""I will offer the prayer throughout the night forever."" The other said, ""I will fast throughout the year and will not break my fast."" The third said, ""I will keep away from the women and will not marry forever."" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to them and said, ""Are you the same people who said so-and-so? By Allah, I am more submissive to Allah and more afraid of Him than you; yet I fast and break my fast, I do sleep and I also marry women.

5064,Narrated 'Urwa:,"He asked `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا about the Statement of Allah: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (the captives) that your right hands possess. That will be nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.' (4.3) `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا said, ""O my nephew! (This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and beauty and intends to marry her with a Mahr less than what other women of her standard deserve.
