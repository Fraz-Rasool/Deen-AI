Allow me to tell you what the Prophet (ﷺ) said on the day following the conquests of Mecca. My ears heard and my heart comprehended, and I saw him with my own eyes, when he said it. He glorified and praised Allah and then said, ""Allah and not the people has made Mecca a sanctuary. So anybody who has belief in Allah and the Last Day (i.e. a Muslim) should neither shed blood in it nor cut down its trees. If anybody argues that fighting is allowed in Mecca as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did fight (in Mecca), tell him that Allah gave permission to His Apostle, but He did not give it to you. The Prophet (ﷺ) added: Allah allowed me only for a few hours on that day (of the conquest) and today (now) its sanctity is the same (valid) as it was before. So it is incumbent upon those who are present to convey it (this information) to those who are absent."" Abu- Shuraih was asked, ""What did `Amr reply?"" He said `Amr said, ""O Abu Shuraih! I know better than you (in this respect).

It is incumbent on those who are present to inform those who are absent."" (Muhammad the Sub-narrator used to say, ""Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) told the truth."")

Abu Juhaifa said, ""I asked, 'What is (written) in this sheet of paper?' `Ali replied, it deals with The Diyya (compensation (blood money) paid by the killer to the relatives of the victim), the ransom for the releasing of the captives from the hands of the enemies, and the law that no Muslim should be killed in Qisas (equality in punishment) for the killing of (a disbeliever).",Knowledge,Sahih Bukhari,1,Sahih

They informed the Prophet (ﷺ) about it. So he rode his Rahila (she-camel for riding) and addressed the people saying, ""Allah held back the killing from Mecca. (The sub-narrator is in doubt whether the Prophet (ﷺ) said ""elephant or killing,"" as the Arabic words standing for these words have great similarity in shape), but He (Allah) let His Apostle and the believers over power the infidels of Mecca. Beware! (Mecca is a sanctuary) Verily! Fighting in Mecca was not permitted for anyone before me nor will it be permitted for anyone after me. It (war) in it was made legal for me for few hours or so on that day. No doubt it is at this moment a sanctuary, it is not allowed to uproot its thorny shrubs or to uproot its trees or to pick up its Luqat (fallen things) except by a person who will look for its owner (announce it publicly). And if somebody is killed, then his closest relative has the right to choose one of the two-- the blood money (Diyya) or retaliation having the killer killed. In the meantime a man from Yemen came and said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Get that written for me."" The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered his companions to write that for him. Then a man from Quraish said, ""Except Al-Idhkhir (a type of grass that has good smell) O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), as we use it in our houses and graves.""

But `Umar said, 'The Prophet is seriously ill, and we have got Allah's Book with us and that is sufficient for us.' But the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) differed about this and there was a hue and cry. On that the Prophet (ﷺ) said to them, 'Go away (and leave me alone). It is not right that you should quarrel in front of me."" Ibn `Abbas came out saying, ""It was most unfortunate (a great disaster) that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was prevented from writing that statement for them because of their disagreement and noise. (Note: It is apparent from this Hadith that Ibn `Abbas had witnessed the event and came out saying this statement. The truth is not so, for Ibn `Abbas used to say this statement on narrating the Hadith and he had not witnessed the event personally. See Fath Al-Bari Vol. 1, p.220 footnote.)

The Prophet (ﷺ) offered the `Isha' prayer (in the mosque), returned home and after having prayed four rak`at, he slept. Later on he got up at night and then asked whether the boy (or he used a similar word) had slept? Then he got up for the prayer and I stood up by his left side but he made me stand to his right and offered five rak`at followed by two more rak`at. Then he slept and I heard him snoring and then (after a while) he left for the (Fajr) prayer.",Knowledge,Sahih Bukhari,1,Sahih
118,Narrated Abu Huraira:,"People say that I have narrated many Hadiths (The Prophet's narration). Had it not been for two verses in the Qur'an, I would not have narrated a single Hadith, and the verses are: ""Verily those who conceal the clear sign and the guidance which We have sent down . . . (up to) Most Merciful."" (2:159-160). And no doubt our Muhajir (emigrant) brothers used to be busy in the market with their business (bargains) and our Ansari brothers used to be busy with their property (agriculture). But I (Abu Huraira) used to stick to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) contented with what will fill my stomach and I used to attend that which they used not to attend and I used to memorize that which they used not to memorize.",Knowledge,Sahih Bukhari,1,Sahih
119,Narrated Abu Huraira:,"I said to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ""I hear many narrations (Hadiths) from you but I forget them."" Allah's Apostle said, ""Spread your Rida' (garment)."" I did accordingly and then he moved his hands as if filling them with something (and emptied them in my Rida') and then said, ""Take and wrap this sheet over your body."" I did it and after that I never forgot any thing. Narrated Ibrahim bin Al-Mundhir: Ibn Abi Fudaik narrated the same as above (Hadith...119) but added that the Prophet (ﷺ) had moved his hands as if filling them with something and then he emptied them in the Rida' of Abu Huraira.",Knowledge,Sahih Bukhari,1,Sahih
120,Narrated Abu Huraira:,"I have memorized two kinds of knowledge from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . I have propagated one of them to you and if I propagated the second, then my pharynx (throat) would be cut (i.e. killed).",Knowledge,Sahih Bukhari,1,Sahih

122,Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair:,"I said to Ibn `Abbas, ""Nauf-Al-Bakali claims that Moses (the companion of Khadir) was not the Moses of Bani Israel but he was another Moses."" Ibn `Abbas remarked that the enemy of Allah (Nauf) was a liar. Narrated Ubai bin Ka`b: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Once the Prophet (ﷺ) Moses stood up and addressed Bani Israel. He was asked, ""Who is the most learned man amongst the people. He said, ""I am the most learned."" Allah admonished Moses as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So Allah inspired to him ""At the junction of the two seas there is a slave amongst my slaves who is more learned than you."" Moses said, ""O my Lord! How can I meet him?"" Allah said: Take a fish in a large basket (and proceed) and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish. So Moses set out along with his (servant) boy, Yusha` bin Noon and carried a fish in a large basket till they reached a rock, where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down) and slept. The fish came out of the basket and it took its way into the sea as in a tunnel. So it was an amazing thing for both Moses and his (servant) boy. They proceeded for the rest of that night and the following day. When the day broke, Moses said to his (servant) boy: ""Bring us our early meal. No doubt, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey."" Moses did not get tired till he passed the place about which he was told. There the (servant) boy told Moses, ""Do you remember when we betook ourselves to the rock, I indeed forgot the fish."" Moses remarked, ""That is what we have been seeking. So they went back retracing their footsteps, till they reached the rock. There they saw a man covered with a garment (or covering himself with his own garment). Moses greeted him. Al-Khadir replied saying, ""How do people greet each other in your land?"" Moses said, ""I am Moses."" He asked, ""The Moses of Bani Israel?"" Moses replied in the affirmative and added, ""May I follow you so that you teach me of that knowledge which you have been taught."" Al-Khadir replied, ""Verily! You will not be able to remain patient with me, O Moses! I have some of the knowledge of Allah which He has taught me and which you do not know, while you have some knowledge which Allah has taught you which I do not know."" Moses said, ""Allah willing, you will find me patient and I will disobey no order of yours. So both of them set out walking along the seashore, as they did not have a boat. In the meantime a boat passed by them and they requested the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and took them on board without fare. Then a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or twice in the sea. Al-Khadir said: ""O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Allah's knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea with its beak."" Al- Khadir went to one of the planks of the boat and plucked it out. Moses said, ""These people gave us a free lift but you have broken their boat and scuttled it so as to drown its people."" Al-Khadir replied, ""Didn't I tell you that you will not be able to remain patient with me."" Moses said, ""Call me not to account for what I forgot."" The first (excuse) of Moses was that he had forgotten. Then they proceeded further and found a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of the boy's head from the top and plucked it out with his hands (i.e. killed him). Moses said, ""Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed none."" Al-Khadir replied, ""Did I not tell you that you cannot remain patient with me?"" Then they both proceeded till when they came to the people of a town, they asked them for food, but they refused to entertain them. Then they found there a wall on the point of collapsing. Al-Khadir repaired it with his own hands. Moses said, ""If you had wished, surely you could have taken wages for it."" Al-Khadir replied, ""This is the parting between you and me."" The Prophet added, ""May Allah be Merciful to Moses! Would that he could have been more patient to learn more about his story with Al-Khadir. """,Knowledge,Sahih Bukhari,1,Sahih
123,Narrated Abu Musa:,"A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and asked, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What kind of fighting is in Allah's cause? (I ask this), for some of us fight because of being enraged and angry and some for the sake of his pride and haughtiness."" The Prophet (ﷺ) raised his head (as the questioner was standing) and said, ""He who fights so that Allah's Word (Islam) should be superior, then he fights in Allah's cause.""",Knowledge,Sahih Bukhari,1,Sahih
124,Narrated `Abdullah:,"I saw the Prophet (ﷺ) near the Jamra and the people were asking him questions (about religious problems). A man asked, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have slaughtered the Hadi (animal) before doing the Rami."" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, ""Do the Rami (now) and there is no harm."" Another person asked, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I got my head shaved before slaughtering the animal."" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, ""Do the slaughtering (now) and there is no harm."" So on that day, when the Prophet (ﷺ) was asked about anything as regards the ceremonies of Hajj performed before or after its due time his reply was, ""Do it (now) and there is no harm.""",Knowledge,Sahih Bukhari,1,Sahih
125,Narrated `Abdullah:,"While I was going with the Prophet (ﷺ) through the ruins of Medina and he was reclining on a date-palm leaf stalk, some Jews passed by. Some of them said to the others: Ask him (the Prophet) about the spirit. Some of them said that they should not ask him that question as he might give a reply which would displease them. But some of them insisted on asking, and so one of them stood up and asked, ""O Abul-Qasim ! What is the spirit?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) remained quiet. I thought he was being inspired Divinely. So I stayed till that state of the Prophet (while being inspired) was over. The Prophet (ﷺ) then said, ""And they ask you (O Muhammad) concerning the spirit --Say: The spirit -- its knowledge is with my Lord. And of knowledge you (mankind) have been given only a little)."" (17.85)",Knowledge,Sahih Bukhari,1,Sahih
