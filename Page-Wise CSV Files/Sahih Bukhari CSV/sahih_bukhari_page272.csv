7086,Narrated Hudhaifa:,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) related to us, two prophetic narrations one of which I have seen fulfilled and I am waiting for the fulfillment of the other. The Prophet (ﷺ) told us that the virtue of honesty descended in the roots of men's hearts (from Allah) and then they learned it from the Qur'an and then they learned it from the Sunna (the Prophet's traditions). The Prophet (ﷺ) further told us how that honesty will be taken away: He said: ""Man will go to sleep during which honesty will be taken away from his heart and only its trace will remain in his heart like the trace of a dark spot; then man will go to sleep, during which honesty will decrease further still, so that its trace will resemble the trace of blister as when an ember is dropped on one's foot which would make it swell, and one would see it swollen but there would be nothing inside. People would be carrying out their trade but hardly will there be a trustworthy person. It will be said, 'in such-and-such tribe there is an honest man,' and later it will be said about some man, 'What a wise, polite and strong man he is!' Though he will not have faith equal even to a mustard seed in his heart."" No doubt, there came upon me a time when I did not mind dealing (bargaining) with anyone of you, for if he was a Muslim his Islam would compel him to pay me what is due to me, and if he was a Christian, the Muslim official would compel him to pay me what is due to me, but today I do not deal except with such-and-such person.",Afflictions and the End of the World,Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih

Then got up a man who, whenever quarreling with somebody, used to be accused of not being the son of his father. He said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Who is my father?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, ""Your father is Hudhaifa."" Then `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ got up and said, ""We accept Allah as our Lord, Islam as our religion and Muhammad as our Apostle and we seek refuge with Allah from the evil of afflictions."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "" I have never seen the good and bad like on this day. No doubt, Paradise and Hell was displayed in front of me till I saw them in front of that wall,"" Qatada said: This Hadith used to be mentioned as an explanation of this Verse:-- 'O you who believe!

7095,Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair:,"`Abdullah bin `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما came to us and we hoped that he would narrate to us a good Hadith. But before we asked him, a man got up and said to him, ""O Abu `Abdur-Rahman! Narrate to us about the battles during the time of the afflictions, as Allah says:-- 'And fight them until there is no more afflictions (i.e. no more worshipping of others besides Allah).'"" (2.193) Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما said (to the man), ""Do you know what is meant by afflictions? Let your mother bereave you! Muhammad used to fight against the pagans, for a Muslim was put to trial in his religion (The pagans will either kill him or chain him as a captive). His fighting was not like your fighting which is carried on for the sake of ruling.""",Afflictions and the End of the World,Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih
