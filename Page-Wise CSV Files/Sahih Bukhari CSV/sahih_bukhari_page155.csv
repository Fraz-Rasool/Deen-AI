4037,Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""Who is willing to kill Ka`b bin Al-Ashraf who has hurt Allah and His Apostle?"" Thereupon Muhammad bin Maslama رضی اللہ عنہ got up saying, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Would you like that I kill him?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Yes,"" Muhammad bin Maslama رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Then allow me to say a (false) thing (i.e. to deceive Ka`b). ""The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""You may say it."" Then Muhammad bin Maslama رضی اللہ عنہ went to Ka`b and said, ""That man (i.e. Muhammad demands Sadaqa (i.e. Zakat) from us, and he has troubled us, and I have come to borrow something from you."" On that, Ka`b said, ""By Allah, you will get tired of him!"" Muhammad bin Maslama رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Now as we have followed him, we do not want to leave him unless and until we see how his end is going to be. Now we want you to lend us a camel load or two of food."" (Some difference between narrators about a camel load or two.) Ka`b said, ""Yes, (I will lend you), but you should mortgage something to me."" Muhammad bin Mas-lama and his companion said, ""What do you want?"" Ka`b replied, ""Mortgage your women to me."" They said, ""How can we mortgage our women to you and you are the most handsome of the 'Arabs?"" Ka`b said, ""Then mortgage your sons to me."" They said, ""How can we mortgage our sons to you? Later they would be abused by the people's saying that so-and-so has been mortgaged for a camel load of food. That would cause us great disgrace, but we will mortgage our arms to you."" Muhammad bin Maslama and his companion promised Ka`b that Muhammad would return to him. He came to Ka`b at night along with Ka`b's foster brother, Abu Na'ila. Ka`b invited them to come into his fort, and then he went down to them. His wife asked him, ""Where are you going at this time?"" Ka`b replied, ""None but Muhammad bin Maslama and my (foster) brother Abu Na'ila have come."" His wife said, ""I hear a voice as if dropping blood is from him, Ka`b said. ""They are none but my brother Muhammad bin Maslama رضی اللہ عنہ and my foster brother Abu Naila. A generous man should respond to a call at night even if invited to be killed."" Muhammad bin Maslama رضی اللہ عنہ went with two men. (Some narrators mention the men as 'Abu bin Jabr. Al Harith bin Aus and `Abbad bin Bishr). So Muhammad bin Maslama رضی اللہ عنہ went in together with two men, and sail to them, ""When Ka`b comes, I will touch his hair and smell it, and when you see that I have got hold of his head, strip him. I will let you smell his head."" Ka`b bin Al-Ashraf came down to them wrapped in his clothes, and diffusing perfume. Muhammad bin Maslama رضی اللہ عنہ said. "" have never smelt a better scent than this. Ka`b replied. ""I have got the best 'Arab women who know how to use the high class of perfume."" Muhammad bin Maslama رضی اللہ عنہ requested Ka`b ""Will you allow me to smell your head?"" Ka`b said, ""Yes."" Muhammad smelt it and made his companions smell it as well. Then he requested Ka`b again, ""Will you let me (smell your head)?"" Ka`b said, ""Yes."" When Muhammad got a strong hold of him, he said (to his companions), ""Get at him!"" So they killed him and went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and informed him. (Abu Rafi`) was killed after Ka`b bin Al-Ashraf.""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4038,Narrated Al-Bara bin Azib رضی اللہ عنہما :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent a group of persons to Abu Rafi`. `Abdullah bin Atik entered his house at night, while he was sleeping, and killed him.",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4039,Narrated Al-Bara bin Azib رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent some men from the Ansar to ((kill) Abu Rafi`, the Jew, and appointed `Abdullah bin Atik رضی اللہ عنہ as their leader. Abu Rafi` used to hurt Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and help his enemies against him. He lived in his castle in the land of Hijaz. When those men approached (the castle) after the sun had set and the people had brought back their livestock to their homes. `Abdullah (bin Atik رضی اللہ عنہ ) said to his companions, ""Sit down at your places. I am going, and I will try to play a trick on the gate-keeper so that I may enter (the castle)."" So `Abdullah proceeded towards the castle, and when he approached the gate, he covered himself with his clothes, pretending to answer the call of nature. The people had gone in, and the gate-keeper (considered `Abdullah as one of the castle's servants) addressing him saying, ""O Allah's Servant! Enter if you wish, for I want to close the gate."" `Abdullah added in his story, ""So I went in (the castle) and hid myself. When the people got inside, the gate-keeper closed the gate and hung the keys on a fixed wooden peg. I got up and took the keys and opened the gate. Some people were staying late at night with Abu Rafi` for a pleasant night chat in a room of his. When his companions of nightly entertainment went away, I ascended to him, and whenever I opened a door, I closed it from inside. I said to myself, 'Should these people discover my presence, they will not be able to catch me till I have killed him.' So I reached him and found him sleeping in a dark house amidst his family, I could not recognize his location in the house. So I shouted, 'O Abu Rafi`!' Abu Rafi` said, 'Who is it?' I proceeded towards the source of the voice and hit him with the sword, and because of my perplexity, I could not kill him. He cried loudly, and I came out of the house and waited for a while, and then went to him again and said, 'What is this voice, O Abu Rafi`?' He said, 'Woe to your mother! A man in my house has hit me with a sword! I again hit him severely but I did not kill him. Then I drove the point of the sword into his belly (and pressed it through) till it touched his back, and I realized that I have killed him. I then opened the doors one by one till I reached the staircase, and thinking that I had reached the ground, I stepped out and fell down and got my leg broken in a moonlit night. I tied my leg with a turban and proceeded on till I sat at the gate, and said, 'I will not go out tonight till I know that I have killed him.' So, when (early in the morning) the cock crowed, the announcer of the casualty stood on the wall saying, 'I announce the death of Abu Rafi`, the merchant of Hijaz. Thereupon I went to my companions and said, 'Let us save ourselves, for Allah has killed Abu Rafi`,' So I (along with my companions proceeded and) went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and described the whole story to him. ""He said, 'Stretch out your (broken) leg. I stretched it out and he rubbed it and it became All right as if I had never had any ailment whatsoever.""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4040,Narrated Al-Bara رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent `Abdullah bin 'Atik and `Abdullah bin `Utba رضی اللہ عنہ with a group of men to Abu Rafi` (to kill him). They proceeded till they approached his castle, whereupon `Abdullah bin Atik رضی اللہ عنہ said to them, ""Wait (here), and in the meantime I will go and see."" `Abdullah said later on, ""I played a trick in order to enter the castle. By chance, they lost a donkey of theirs and came out carrying a flaming light to search for it. I was afraid that they would recognize me, so I covered my head and legs and pretended to answer the call to nature. The gatekeeper called, 'Whoever wants to come in, should come in before I close the gate.' So I went in and hid myself in a stall of a donkey near the gate of the castle. They took their supper with Abu Rafi` and had a chat till late at night. Then they went back to their homes. When the voices vanished and I no longer detected any movement, I came out. I had seen where the gate-keeper had kept the key of the castle in a hole in the wall. I took it and unlocked the gate of the castle, saying to myself, 'If these people should notice me, I will run away easily.' Then I locked all the doors of their houses from outside while they were inside, and ascended to Abu Rafi` by a staircase. I saw the house in complete darkness with its light off, and I could not know where the man was. So I called, 'O Abu Rafi`!' He replied, 'Who is it?' I proceeded towards the voice and hit him. He cried loudly but my blow was futile. Then I came to him, pretending to help him, saying with a different tone of my voice, ' What is wrong with you, O Abu Rafi`?' He said, 'Are you not surprised? Woe on your mother! A man has come to me and hit me with a sword!' So again I aimed at him and hit him, but the blow proved futile again, and on that Abu Rafi` cried loudly and his wife got up. I came again and changed my voice as if I were a helper, and found Abu Rafi` lying straight on his back, so I drove the sword into his belly and bent on it till I heard the sound of a bone break. Then I came out, filled with astonishment and went to the staircase to descend, but I fell down from it and got my leg dislocated. I bandaged it and went to my companions limping. I said (to them), 'Go and tell Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) of this good news, but I will not leave (this place) till I hear the news of his (i.e. Abu Rafi`'s) death.' When dawn broke, an announcer of death got over the wall and announced, 'I convey to you the news of Abu Rafi`'s death.' I got up and proceeded without feeling any pain till I caught up with my companions before they reached the Prophet (ﷺ) to whom I conveyed the good news.""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

4042,Narrated `Uqba bin Amir رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) offered the funeral prayers of the martyrs of Uhud eight years after (their death), as if bidding farewell to the living and the dead, then he ascended the pulpit and said, ""I am your predecessor before you, and I am a witness on you, and your promised place to meet me will be Al- Haud (i.e. the Tank) (on the Day of Resurrection), and I am (now) looking at it from this place of mine. I am not afraid that you will worship others besides Allah, but I am afraid that worldly life will tempt you and cause you to compete with each other for it."" Hadrat Uqbah رضی اللہ عنہ says: It was the last look which I cast on Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
"4043, 4044",Narrated Al-Bara رضی اللہ عنہ :,"We faced the pagans on that day (of the battle of Uhud) and the Prophet (ﷺ) placed a batch of archers (at a special place) and appointed `Abdullah (bin Jubair رضی اللہ عنہما) as their commander and said, ""Do not leave this place; if you should see us conquering the enemy, do not leave this place, and if you should see them conquering us, do not (come to) help us,"" So, when we faced the enemy, they took to their heels till I saw their women running towards the mountain, lifting up their clothes from their legs, revealing their leg-bangles. The Muslims started saying, ""The booty, the booty!"" `Abdullah bin Jubair رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""The Prophet (ﷺ) had taken a firm promise from me not to leave this place."" But his companions refused (to stay). So when they refused (to stay there), (Allah) confused them so that they could not know where to go, and they suffered seventy casualties. Abu Sufyan ascended a high place and said, ""Is Muhammad present amongst the people?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Do not answer him."" Abu Sufyan said, ""Is the son of Abu Quhafa present among the people?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Do not answer him."" `Abu Sufyan said, ""Is the son of Al-Khattab amongst the people?"" He then added, ""All these people have been killed, for, were they alive, they would have replied."" On that, `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ could not help saying, ""You are a liar, O enemy of Allah! Allah has kept what will make you unhappy."" Abu Sufyan said, ""Superior may be Hubal!"" On that the Prophet said (to his companions), ""Reply to him."" They asked, ""What may we say?"" He said, ""Say: Allah is More Elevated and More Majestic!"" Abu Sufyan said, ""We have (the idol) Al-`Uzza, whereas you have no `Uzza!"" The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to his companions), ""Reply to him."" They said, ""What may we say?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Say: Allah is our Helper and you have no helper."" Abu Sufyan said, ""(This) day compensates for our loss at Badr and (in) the battle (the victory) is always undecided and shared in turns by the belligerents. You will see some of your dead men mutilated, but neither did I urge this action, nor am I sorry for it.""

4047,Narrated Khabbab bin Al-Art رضی اللہ عنہ :,"We migrated in the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), seeking Allah's Pleasure. So our reward became due and sure with Allah. Some of us have been dead without enjoying anything of their rewards (here), and one of them was Mus'ab bin 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ who was martyred on the day of the battle of Uhud, and did not leave anything except a Namira (i.e. a sheet in which he was shrouded). If we covered his head with it, his feet became naked, and if we covered his feet with it, his head became naked. So the Prophet (ﷺ) said to us, ""Cover his head with it and put some Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass) over his feet or throw Idhkhir over his feet."" But some amongst us have got the fruits of their labor ripened, and they are collecting them.",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

So he encountered the day of Uhud battle. The Muslims fled and he said, ""O Allah ! I appeal to You to excuse me for what these people (i.e. the Muslims) have done, and I am clear from what the pagans have done."" Then he went forward with his sword and met Sad bin Mu'adh رضی اللہ عنہ (fleeing), and asked him, ""Where are you going, O Sad? I detect a smell of Paradise before Uhud."" Then he proceeded on and was martyred. No-body was able to recognize him till his sister recognized him by a mole on his body or by the tips of his fingers.

4049,Narrated Zaid bin Thabit رضی اللہ عنہ :,"When we wrote the Holy Qur'an, I missed one of the Verses of Surat-al-Ahzab which I used to hear Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) reciting. Then we searched for it and found it with Khuza`ima bin Thabit Al-Ansari رضی اللہ عنہ . The Verse was:-- 'Among the Believers are men Who have been true to Their Covenant with Allah, Of them, some have fulfilled Their obligations to Allah (i.e. they have been Killed in Allah's Cause), And some of them are (still) waiting"" (33.23) So we wrote this in its place in the Qur'an.",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

The companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) were divided into two groups. One group said, ""We will fight them (i.e. the enemy),"" and the other group said, ""We will not fight them."" So there came the Divine Revelation:-- '(O Muslims!) Then what is the matter within you that you are divided. Into two parties about the hypocrites? Allah has cast them back (to disbelief) Because of what they have earned.'

My father was martyred on the day of Uhud and left nine (orphan) daughters who are my nine sisters; so I disliked to have another young girl of their age, but (I sought) an (elderly) woman who could comb their hair and look after them.""

The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Go and pile every kind of dates apart."" I did so and called him (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ). When the creditors saw him, they started claiming their debts from me then in such a harsh manner (as they had never done before). So when he saw their attitude, he went round the biggest heap of dates thrice, and then sat over it and said, 'O Jabir), call your companions (i.e. the creditors).' Then he kept on measuring (and giving) to the creditors (their due) till Allah paid all the debt of my father. I would have been satisfied to retain nothing of those dates for my sisters after Allah had paid the debts of my father. But Allah saved all the heaps (of dates), so that when I looked at the heap where the Prophet (ﷺ) had been sitting, it seemed as if a single date had not been taken away thereof.""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
