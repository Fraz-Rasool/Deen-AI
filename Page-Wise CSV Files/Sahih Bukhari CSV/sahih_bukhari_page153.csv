3983,Narrated `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent me, Abu Marthad رضی اللہ عنہ and Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ , and all of us were riding horses, and said, ""Go till you reach Raudat-Khakh where there is a pagan woman carrying a letter from Hatib bin Abi Balta' a to the pagans of Mecca."" So we found her riding her camel at the place which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had mentioned. We said (to her),""(Give us) the letter."" She said, ""I have no letter."" Then we made her camel kneel down and we searched her, but we found no letter. Then we said, ""Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had not told us a lie, certainly. Take out the letter, otherwise we will strip you naked."" When she saw that we were determined, she put her hand below her waist belt, for she had tied her cloak round her waist, and she took out the letter, and we brought her to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) Then `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""O Allah's Apostle! (This Hatib) has betrayed Allah, His Apostle and the believers! Let me cut off his neck!"" The Prophet asked Hatib, ""What made you do this?"" Hatib said, ""By Allah, I did not intend to give up my belief in Allah and His Apostle but I wanted to have some influence among the (Mecca) people so that through it, Allah might protect my family and property. There is none of your companions but has some of his relatives there through whom Allah protects his family and property."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""He has spoken the truth; do no say to him but good."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""He as betrayed Allah, His Apostle and the faithful believers. Let me cut off his neck!"" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Is he not one of the Badr warriors? May be Allah looked at the Badr warriors and said, 'Do whatever you like, as I have granted Paradise to you, or said, 'I have forgiven you.""' On this, tears came out of `Umar's eyes, and he said, ""Allah and His Apostle know better.""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

3986,Narrated Al-Bara' bin `Azib رضی اللہ عنہ :,"On the day of Uhud the Prophet (ﷺ) appointed `Abdullah bin Jubair رضی اللہ عنہ as chief of the archers, and seventy among us were injured and martyred. On the day (of the battle) of Badr, the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions had inflicted 140 casualties on the pagans, 70 were taken prisoners, and 70 were killed. Abu Sufyan said, ""This is a day of (revenge) for the day of Badr and the issue of war is undecided .""",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

3988,Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf رضی اللہ عنہ :,"While I was fighting in the front file on the day (of the battle) of Badr, suddenly I looked behind and saw on my right and left two young boys and did not feel safe by standing between them. Then one of them asked me secretly so that his companion may not hear, ""O Uncle! Show me Abu Jahl."" I said, ""O nephew! What will you do to him?"" He said, ""I have promised Allah that if I see him (i.e. Abu Jahl), I will either kill him or be killed before I kill him."" Then the other said the same to me secretly so that his companion should not hear. I would not have been pleased to be in between two other men instead of them. Then I pointed him (i.e. Abu Jahl) out to them. Both of them attacked him like two hawks till they knocked him down. Those two boys were the sons of 'Afra' (i.e. an Ansari woman).",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
3989,Narrated Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent out ten spies under the command of `Asim bin Thabit Al-Ansari رضی اللہ عنہ , the grand-father of `Asim bin `Umar Al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ . When they reached (a place called) Al-Hadah between 'Usfan and Mecca, their presence was made known to a sub-tribe of Hudhail called Banu Lihyan. So they sent about one hundred archers after them. The archers traced the footsteps (of the Muslims) till they found the traces of dates which they had eaten at one of their camping places. The archers said, ""These dates are of Yathrib (i.e. Medina),"" and went on tracing the Muslims' footsteps. When `Asim رضی اللہ عنہ and his companions became aware of them, they took refuge in a (high) place. But the enemy encircled them and said, ""Come down and surrender. We give you a solemn promise and covenant that we will not kill anyone of you."" `Asim bin Thabit رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""O people! As for myself, I will never get down to be under the protection of an infidel. O Allah! Inform your Prophet about us."" So the archers threw their arrows at them and martyred `Asim. Three of them came down and surrendered to them, accepting their promise and covenant and they were Khubaib رضی اللہ عنہ, Zaid bin Ad-Dathina رضی اللہ عنہ and another man. When the archers got hold of them, they untied the strings of the arrow bows and tied their captives with them. The third man said, ""This is the first proof of treachery! By Allah, I will not go with you for I follow the example of these."" He meant the martyred companions. The archers dragged him and struggled with him (till they martyred him). Then Khubaib رضی اللہ عنہ anAd Zaid bin Ad-Dathina were taken away by them and later on they sold them as slaves in Mecca after the event of the Badr battle. The sons of Al-Harit bin `Amr bin Naufal bought Khubaib for he was a person who had killed (their father) Al-Hari bin `Amr on the day (of the battle) of Badr. Khubaib رضی اللہ عنہ remained imprisoned by them till they decided unanimously to kill him. One day Khubaib رضی اللہ عنہ borrowed from a daughter of Al-Harith, a razor for shaving his pubic hair, and she lent it to him. By chance, while she was inattentive, a little son of hers went to him (i.e. Khubaib) and she saw that Khubaib رضی اللہ عنہ had seated him on his thigh while the razor was in his hand. She was so much terrified that Khubaib رضی اللہ عنہ noticed her fear and said, ""Are you afraid that I will kill him? Never would I do such a thing."" Later on (while narrating the story) she said, ""By Allah, I had never seen a better captive than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating from a bunch of grapes in his hand while he was fettered with iron chains and (at that time) there was no fruit in Mecca."" She used to say,"" It was food Allah had provided Khubaib رضی اللہ عنہ with."" When they took him to Al-Hil out of Mecca sanctuary to martyr him, Khubaib رضی اللہ عنہ requested them. ""Allow me to offer a two-rak`at prayer."" They allowed him and he prayed two rak`at and then said, ""By Allah! Had I not been afraid that you would think I was worried, I would have prayed more."" Then he (invoked evil upon them) saying, ""O Allah! Count them and kill them one by one, and do not leave anyone of them""' Then he recited: ""As I am martyred as a Muslim, I do not care in what way I receive my death for Allah's Sake, for this is for the Cause of Allah. If He wishes, He will bless the cut limbs of my body."" Then Abu Sarva, 'Ubqa bin Al-Harith went up to him and killed him. It was Khubaib رضی اللہ عنہ who set the tradition of praying for any Muslim to be martyred in captivity (before he is executed). The Prophet (ﷺ) told his companions of what had happened (to those ten spies) on the same day they were martyred. Some Quraish people, being informed of `Asim bin Thabit's death, sent some messengers to bring a part of his body so that his death might be known for certain, for he had previously killed one of their leaders (in the battle of Badr). But Allah sent a swarm of wasps to protect the dead body of `Asim رضی اللہ عنہ, and they shielded him from the messengers who could not cut anything from his body. Hadrat Ka'b bin Malik states of his body. Hadrat Mararah bin Rabi Amri رضی اللہ عنہ and Hadrat Hilal bin Omayyah Waqifi رضی اللہ عنہ both were noble men and both participated in the battle of Badr.",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
3990,Narrated Nafi:,"Ibn 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہما was once told that Said bin Zaid bin 'Amr bin Nufail رضی اللہ عنہما , one of the Badr warriors, had fallen ill on a Friday.

The time of the Friday prayer approached and Ibn 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہما did not take part in the Friday prayer.",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
3991,Narrated Subaia bint Al-Harith رضی اللہ عنہا :,"She was married to Sad bin Khaula رضی اللہ عنہاwho was from the tribe of Bani 'Amr bin Luai, and was one of those who fought the Badr battle. He died while she was pregnant during Hajjat-ul-Wada.' Soon after his death, she gave birth to a child. When she completed the term of deliver (i.e. became clean), she prepared herself for suitors. Abu As-Sanabil bin Bu'kak رضی اللہ عنہ , a man from the tribe of Bani Abd-ud-Dal called on her and said to her, ""What! I see you dressed up for the people to ask you in marriage. Do you want to marry By Allah, you are not allowed to marry unless four months and ten days have elapsed (after your husband's death)."" Subai'a in her narration said, ""When he (i.e. Abu As-Sanabil) said this to me. I put on my dress in the evening and went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and asked him about this problem. He gave the verdict that I was free to marry as I had already given birth to my child and ordered me to marry if I wished.""

Rafi` used to say to his son, ""I would not have been happier if I had taken part in the Badr battle instead of taking part in the 'Aqaba pledge.""

He went to his maternal brother, Qatada bin Ni 'man رضی اللہ عنہ , who was one of the Badr warriors, and asked him about it.

He was surnamed Abu Dhat-al-Karish. He said (proudly), 'I am Abu-al-Karish.' I attacked him with the spear and pierced his eye and he died.

And when I intended to celebrate my marriage to Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet, I made an arrangement with a goldsmith from Bani Qainuqa 'that he should go with me to bring Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass used by gold-smiths) which I intended to sell to gold-smiths in order to spend its price on the marriage banquet. While I was collecting ropes and sacks of pack saddles for my two she-camels which were kneeling down beside an Ansari's dwelling and after collecting what I needed, I suddenly found that the humps of the two she-camels had been cut off and their flanks had been cut open and portions of their livers had been taken out. On seeing that, I could not help weeping. I asked, ""Who has done that?"" They (i.e. the people) said, ""Hamza bin `Abdul Muttalib رضی اللہ عنہ has done it. He is present in this house with some Ansari drinkers, a girl singer, and his friends. The singer said in her song, ""O Hamza رضی اللہ عنہ , get at the fat she-camels!"" On hearing this, Hamza رضی اللہ عنہ rushed to his sword and cut of the camels' humps and cut their flanks open and took out portions from their livers."" Then I came to the Prophet, with whom Zaid bin Haritha was present. The Prophet (ﷺ) noticed my state and asked, ""What is the matter?"" I said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), I have never experienced such a day as today! Hamza رضی اللہ عنہ attacked my two she-camels, cut off their humps and cut their flanks open, and he is still present in a house along some drinkers."" The Prophet (ﷺ) asked for his cloak, put it on, and proceeded, followed by Zaid bin Haritha and myself, till he reached the house where Hamza رضی اللہ عنہ was. He asked the permission to enter, and he was permitted. The Prophet (ﷺ) started blaming Hamza رضی اللہ عنہ for what he had done. Hamza رضی اللہ عنہ was drunk and his eyes were red. He looked at the Prophet (ﷺ) then raised his eyes to look at his knees and raised his eves more to look at his face and then said, ""You are not but my father's slaves.""
