1386,Narrated Samura bin Jundab رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Whenever the Prophet (ﷺ) finished the (morning) prayer, he would face us and ask, ""Who amongst you had a dream last night?"" So if anyone had seen a dream he would narrate it. The Prophet (ﷺ) would say: ""Ma sha'a-llah"" (An Arabic maxim meaning literally, 'What Allah wished,' and it indicates a good omen.) One day, he asked us whether anyone of us had seen a dream. We replied in the negative. The Prophet said, ""But I had seen (a dream) last night that two men came to me, caught hold of my hands, and took me to the Sacred Land (Jerusalem). There, I saw a person sitting and another standing with an iron hook in his hand pushing it inside the mouth of the former till it reached the jawbone, and then tore off one side of his cheek, and then did the same with the other side; in the meantime the first side of his cheek became normal again and then he repeated the same operation again. I said, 'What is this?' They told me to proceed on and we went on till we came to a man Lying flat on his back, and another man standing at his head carrying a stone or a piece of rock, and crushing the head of the Lying man, with that stone. Whenever he struck him, the stone rolled away. The man went to pick it up and by the time he returned to him, the crushed head had returned to its normal state and the man came back and struck him again (and so on). I said, 'Who is this?' They told me to proceed on; so we proceeded on and passed by a hole like an oven; with a narrow top and wide bottom, and the fire was kindling underneath that hole. Whenever the fire-flame went up, the people were lifted up to such an extent that they about to get out of it, and whenever the fire got quieter, the people went down into it, and there were naked men and women in it. I said, 'Who is this?' They told me to proceed on. So we proceeded on till we reached a river of blood and a man was in it, and another man was standing at its bank with stones in front of him, facing the man standing in the river. Whenever the man in the river wanted to come out, the other one threw a stone in his mouth and caused him to retreat to his original position; and so whenever he wanted to come out the other would throw a stone in his mouth, and he would retreat to his original position. I asked, 'What is this?' They told me to proceed on and we did so till we reached a well-flourished green garden having a huge tree and near its root was sitting an old man with some children. (I saw) Another man near the tree with fire in front of him and he was kindling it up. Then they (i.e. my two companions) made me climb up the tree and made me enter a house, better than which I have ever seen. In it were some old men and young men, women and children. Then they took me out of this house and made me climb up the tree and made me enter another house that was better and superior (to the first) containing old and young people. I said to them (i.e. my two companions), 'You have made me ramble all the night. Tell me all about that I have seen.' They said, 'Yes. As for the one whose cheek you saw being torn away, he was a liar and he used to tell lies, and the people would report those lies on his authority till they spread all over the world. So, he will be punished like that till the Day of Resurrection. The one whose head you saw being crushed is the one whom Allah had given the knowledge of Qur'an (i.e. knowing it by heart) but he used to sleep at night (i.e. he did not recite it then) and did not use to act upon it (i.e. upon its orders etc.) by day; and so this punishment will go on till the Day of Resurrection. And those you saw in the hole (like oven) were adulterers (those men and women who commit illegal sexual intercourse). And those you saw in the river of blood were those dealing in Riba (usury). And the old man who was sitting at the base of the tree was Abraham and the little children around him were the offspring of the people. And the one who was kindling the fire was Malik, the gatekeeper of the Hell-fire. And the first house in which you have gone was the house of the common believers, and the second house was of the martyrs. I am Gabriel and this is Michael. Raise your head.' I raised my head and saw a thing like a cloud over me. They said, 'That is your place.' I said, 'Let me enter my place.' They said, 'You still have some life which you have not yet completed, and when you complete (that remaining portion of your life) you will then enter your place.'

1387,Narrated Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"""I went to Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ (during his fatal illness) and he asked me, 'In how many garments was the Prophet (ﷺ) shrouded?' She replied, 'In three Suhuliya pieces of white cloth of cotton, and there was neither a shirt nor a turban among them.' Abu Bakr further asked her, 'On which day did the Prophet die?' She replied, 'He died on Monday.' He asked, 'What is today?' She replied, 'Today is Monday.' He added, 'I hope I shall die sometime between this morning and tonight.' Then he looked at a garment that he was wearing during his illness and it had some stains of saffron. Then he said, 'Wash this garment of mine and add two more garments and shroud me in them.' I said, 'This is worn out.' He said, 'A living person has more right to wear new clothes than a dead one; the shroud is only for the body's pus.' He did not die till it was the night of Tuesday and was buried before the morning.""",Funerals (Al-Janaa'iz),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1388,Narrated Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"A man said to the Prophet (ﷺ), ""My mother died suddenly and I thought that if she had lived she would have given alms.

1389,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"During his sickness, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was asking repeatedly, ""Where am I today? Where will I be tomorrow?""

Then, when my turn came, Allah took his soul away (in my lap) between my chest and arms and he was buried in my house.",Funerals (Al-Janaa'iz),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1390,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in his fatal illness said, ""Allah cursed the Jews and the Christians, for they built the places of worship at the graves of their prophets."" And if that had not been the case, then the Prophet's grave would have been made prominent before the people. So (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) was afraid, or the people were afraid that his grave might be taken as a place for worship. It is narrated from Hilal that Urwa bin Zubair had given my surname (Abu Awana meaning father of Awana), otherwise I would not have had any children. Sufyan at-Tammar told me that he had seen the grave of the Prophet (ﷺ) elevated and convex. Hadrat Hisham bin Urwa has reported from his father: When the wall fell on them (i.e. graves) during the caliphate of Al-Walid bin `Abdul Malik, the people started repairing it, and a foot appeared to them. The people got scared and thought that it was the foot of the Prophet. No one could be found who could tell them about it till I (`Urwa) said to them, ""By Allah, this is not the foot of the Prophet (ﷺ) but it is the foot of `Umar.""",Funerals (Al-Janaa'iz),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1391,Narrated Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"She made a will to `Abdullah bin Zubair رضی اللہ عنہما , ""Do not bury me with them (the Prophet (ﷺ) and his two companions) but bury me with my companions (wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) ) in Al-Baqi as I would not like to be looked upon as better than I really am (by being buried near the Prophet).""",Funerals (Al-Janaa'iz),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1392,Narrated `Amr bin Maimun Al-Audi:,"I saw `Umar bin Al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ (when he was stabbed) saying, ""O `Abdullah bin `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ ! Go to the mother of the believers Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا and say, `Umar bin Al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ sends his greetings to you,' and request her to allow me to be buried with my companions."" (So, Ibn `Umar conveyed the message to `Aisha.) She said, ""I had the idea of having this place for myself but today I prefer him (`Umar رضی اللہ عنہ ) to myself (and allow him to be buried there)."" When `Abdullah bin `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ returned, `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ asked him, ""What (news) do you have?"" He replied, ""O chief of the believers! She has allowed you (to be buried there)."" On that `Umar said, ""Nothing was more important to me than to be buried in that (sacred) place. So, when I expire, carry me there and pay my greetings to her (`Aisha ) and say, `Umar bin Al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ asks permission; and if she gives permission, then bury me (there) and if she does not, then take me to the graveyard of the Muslims. I do not think any person has more right for the caliphate than those with whom Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was always pleased till his death. And whoever is chosen by the people after me will be the caliph, and you people must listen to him and obey him,"" and then he mentioned the name of `Uthman, `Ali, Talha, Az-Zubair, `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf and Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas. By this time a young man from Ansar came and said, ""O chief of the believers! Be happy with Allah's glad tidings. The grade which you have in Islam is known to you, then you became the caliph and you ruled with justice and then you have been awarded martyrdom after all this."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ replied, ""O son of my brother! Would that all that privileges will counterbalance (my short comings), so that I neither lose nor gain anything. I recommend my successor to be good to the early emigrants and realize their rights and to protect their honor and sacred things. And I also recommend him to be good to the Ansar who before them, had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the Faith. He should accept the good of the righteous among them and should excuse their wrongdoers. I recommend him to abide by the rules and regulations concerning the Dhimmis (protectees) of Allah and His Apostle, to fulfill their contracts completely and fight for them and not to tax (overburden) them beyond their capabilities.""",Funerals (Al-Janaa'iz),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
