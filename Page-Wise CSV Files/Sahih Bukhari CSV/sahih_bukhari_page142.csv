3699,Narrated Anas رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) ascended the mountain of Uhud and Abu Bakr, `Umar and `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہم were accompanying him. The mountain gave a shake (i.e. trembled underneath them) . The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""O Uhud ! Be calm."" I think that the Prophet (ﷺ) hit it with his foot, adding, ""For upon you there are none but a Prophet, a Siddiq and two martyrs.""",Companions of the Prophet,Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
3700,Narrated `Amr bin Maimun:,"I saw `Umar bin Al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ a few days before he was stabbed in Medina. He was standing with Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman and `Uthman bin Hunaif رضی اللہ عنہما to whom he said, ""What have you done? Do you think that you have imposed more taxation on the land (of As-Swad i.e. 'Iraq) than it can bear?"" They replied, ""We have imposed on it what it can bear because of its great yield."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ again said, ""Check whether you have imposed on the land what it can not bear."" They said, ""No, (we haven't)."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ added, ""If Allah should keep me alive I will let the widows of Iraq need no men to support them after me."" But only four days had elapsed when he was stabbed (to death ). The day he was stabbed, I was standing and there was nobody between me and him (i.e. `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ) except `Abdullah bin `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما . Whenever `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ passed between the two rows, he would say, ""Stand in straight lines."" When he saw no defect (in the rows), he would go forward and start the prayer with Takbir. He would recite Surat Yusuf or An-Nahl or the like in the first rak`a so that the people may have the time to Join the prayer. As soon as he said Takbir, I heard him saying, ""The dog has killed or eaten me,"" at the time he (i.e. the murderer) stabbed him. A non-Arab infidel proceeded on carrying a double-edged knife and stabbing all the persons he passed by on the right and left (till) he stabbed thirteen persons out of whom seven died. When one of the Muslims saw that, he threw a cloak on him. Realizing that he had been captured, the non-Arab infidel killed himself, `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ held the hand of `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf and let him lead the prayer. Those who were standing by the side of `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ saw what I saw, but the people who were in the other parts of the Mosque did not see anything, but they lost the voice of `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ and they were saying, ""Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! (i.e. Glorified be Allah)."" `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf led the people a short prayer. When they finished the prayer, `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""O Ibn `Abbas! Find out who attacked me."" Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما kept on looking here and there for a short time and came to say. ""The slave of Al Mughira."" On that `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""The craftsman?"" Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما said, ""Yes."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""May Allah curse him. I did not treat him unjustly. All the Praises are for Allah Who has not caused me to die at the hand of a man who claims himself to be a Muslim. No doubt, you and your father (Abbas) used to love to have more non-Arab infidels in Medina."" Al-Abbas had the greatest number of slaves. Ibn `Abbas said to `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ. ""If you wish, we will do."" He meant, ""If you wish we will kill them."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""You are mistaken (for you can't kill them) after they have spoken your language, prayed towards your Qibla, and performed Hajj like yours."" Then `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ was carried to his house, and we went along with him, and the people were as if they had never suffered a calamity before. Some said, ""Do not worry (he will be Alright soon)."" Some said, ""We are afraid (that he will die)."" Then an infusion of dates was brought to him and he drank it but it came out (of the wound) of his belly. Then milk was brought to him and he drank it, and it also came out of his belly. The people realized that he would die. We went to him, and the people came, praising him. A young man came saying, ""O chief of the believers! Receive the glad tidings from Allah to you due to your company with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and your superiority in Islam which you know. Then you became the ruler (i.e. Caliph) and you ruled with justice and finally you have been martyred."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I wish that all these privileges will counterbalance (my shortcomings) so that I will neither lose nor gain anything."" When the young man turned back to leave, his clothes seemed to be touching the ground. `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Call the young man back to me."" (When he came back) `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""O son of my brother! Lift your clothes, for this will keep your clothes clean and save you from the Punishment of your Lord."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ further said, ""O `Abdullah bin `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما ! See how much I am in debt to others."" When the debt was checked, it amounted to approximately eighty-six thousand. `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""If the property of `Umar's family covers the debt, then pay the debt thereof; otherwise request it from Bani `Adi bin Ka`b, and if that too is not sufficient, ask for it from Quraish tribe, and do not ask for it from any one else, and pay this debt on my behalf."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ then said (to `Abdullah), ""Go to `Aisha (the mother of the believers) and say: ""`Umar رضی اللہ عنہ is paying his salutation to you. But don't say: 'The chief of the believers,' because today I am not the chief of the believers. And say: ""`Umar رضی اللہ عنہ bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to be buried with his two companions (i.e. the Prophet, and Abu Bakr)."" `Abdullah greeted `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا and asked for the permission for entering, and then entered to her and found her sitting and weeping. He said to her, ""`Umar bin Al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ is paying his salutations to you, and asks the permission to be buried with his two companions."" She said, ""I had the idea of having this place for myself, but today I prefer `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ to myself."" When he returned it was said (to `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ), ""`Abdullah bin `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ has come."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Make me sit up."" Somebody supported him against his body and `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ asked (`Abdullah), ""What news do you have?"" He said, ""O chief of the believers! It is as you wish. She has given the permission."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Praise be to Allah, there was nothing more important to me than this. So when I die, take me, and greet `Aisha and say: ""`Umar bin Al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ asks the permission (to be buried with the Prophet (ﷺ) ), and if she gives the permission, bury me there, and if she refuses, then take me to the grave-yard of the Muslims."" Then Hafsa (the mother of the believers) came with many other women walking with her. When we saw her, we went away. She went in (to `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ) and wept there for sometime. When the men asked for permission to enter, she went into another place, and we heard her weeping inside. The people said (to `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ), ""O chief of the believers! Appoint a successor."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I do not find anyone more suitable for the job than the following persons or group whom Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had been pleased with before he died."" Then `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ mentioned `Ali, `Uthman, Az Zubair, Talha, Sa`d and `Abdur-Rahman (bin `Auf) and said, ""Abdullah bin `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ will be a witness to you, but he will have no share in the rule. His being a witness will compensate him for not sharing the right of ruling. If Sa`d becomes the ruler, it will be alright: otherwise, whoever becomes the ruler should seek his help, as I have not dismissed him because of disability or dishonesty."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ added, ""I recommend that my successor takes care of the early emigrants; to know their rights and protect their honor and sacred things. I also recommend that he be kind to the Ansar who had lived in Medina before the emigrants and Belief had entered their hearts before them. I recommend that the (ruler) should accept the good of the righteous among them and excuse their wrong-doers, and I recommend that he should do good to all the people of the towns (Al-Ansar), as they are the protectors of Islam and the source of wealth and the source of annoyance to the enemy. I also recommend that nothing be taken from them except from their surplus with their consent. I also recommend that he do good to the 'Arab bedouin, as they are the origin of the 'Arabs and the material of Islam. He should take from what is inferior, amongst their properties and distribute that to the poor amongst them. I also recommend him concerning Allah's and His Apostle's protectees (i.e. Dhimmis) to fulfill their contracts and to fight for them and not to overburden them with what is beyond their ability."" So when `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ expired, we carried him out and set out walking. `Abdullah bin `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما greeted (`Aisha) and said, ""`Umar رضی اللہ عنہ bin Al-Khattab asks for the permission."" `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا said, ""Bring him in."" He was brought in and buried beside his two companions. When he was buried, the group (recommended by `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ) held a meeting. Then `Abdur-Rahman said, "" Reduce the candidates for rulership to three of you."" Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I give up my right to `Ali."" Talha said, ""I give up my right to `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ ,"" Sa`d رضی اللہ عنہ , 'I give up my right to `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf."" `Abdur-Rahman then said (to `Uthman and `Ali), ""Now which of you is willing to give up his right of candidacy to that he may choose the better of the (remaining) two, bearing in mind that Allah and Islam will be his witnesses."" So both the sheiks (i.e. `Uthman and `Ali رضی اللہ عنہما ) kept silent. `Abdur-Rahman said, ""Will you both leave this matter to me, and I take Allah as my Witness that I will not choose but the better of you?"" They said, ""Yes."" So `Abdur-Rahman took the hand of one of them (i.e. `Ali) and said, ""You are related to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and one of the earliest Muslims as you know well. So I ask you by Allah to promise that if I select you as a ruler you will do justice, and if I select `Uthman as a ruler you will listen to him and obey him."" Then he took the other (i.e. `Uthman) aside and said the same to him. When `Abdur-Rahman secured (their agreement to) this covenant, he said, ""O `Uthman! Raise your hand."" So he (i.e. `Abdur-Rahman) gave him (i.e. `Uthman) the solemn pledge, and then `Ali gave him the pledge of allegiance and then all the (Medina) people gave him the pledge of allegiance.",Companions of the Prophet,Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
3701,Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""Tomorrow I will give the flag to a man with whose leadership Allah will grant (the Muslim) victory."" So the people kept on thinking the whole night as to who would be given the flag. The next morning the people went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and every one of them hoped that he would be given the flag. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Where is `Ali bin Abi Talib?"" The people replied, ""He is suffering from eye trouble, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)."" He said, ""Send for him and bring him to me."" So when `Ali came, the Prophet (ﷺ) spat in his eyes and invoked good on him, and be became alright as if he had no ailment. The Prophet (ﷺ) then gave him the flag. `Ali said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Shall I fight them (i.e. enemy) till they become like us?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Proceed to them steadily till you approach near to them and then invite them to Islam and inform them of their duties towards Allah which Islam prescribes for them, for by Allah, if one man is guided on the right path (i.e. converted to Islam) through you, it would be better for you than (a great number of) red camels.""",Companions of the Prophet,Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
3702,Narrated Salama رضی اللہ عنہ :,"`Ali رضی اللہ عنہ happened to stay behind the Prophet (ﷺ) and (did not join him) during the battle of Khaibar for he was having eye trouble. Then he said, ""How could I remain behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?"" So `Ali set out following the Prophet (ﷺ) , When it was the eve of the day in the morning of which Allah helped (the Muslims) to conquer it, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""I will give the flag (to a man), or tomorrow a man whom Allah and His Apostle love will take the flag,"" or said, ""A man who loves Allah and His Apostle; and Allah will grant victory under his leadership."" Suddenly came `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ whom we did not expect. The people said, ""This is `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ ."" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave him the flag and Allah granted victory under his leadership.",Companions of the Prophet,Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
3703,Narrated Abu Hazim:,"A man came to Sahl bin Sa`d رضی اللہ عنہ and said, ""This is so-and-so,"" meaning the Governor of Medina, ""He is calling `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ bad names near the pulpit."" Sahl رضی اللہ عنہ asked, ""What is he saying?"" He (i.e. the man) replied, ""He calls him (i.e. `Ali) Abu Turab."" Sahl رضی اللہ عنہ laughed and said, ""By Allah, none but the Prophet (ﷺ) called him by this name and no name was dearer to `Ali than this."" So I asked Sahl رضی اللہ عنہ to tell me more, saying, ""O Abu `Abbas! How (was this name given to `Ali)?"" Sahl said, ""`Ali went to Fatima رضی اللہ عنہا and then came out and slept in the Mosque. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked Fatima رضی اللہ عنہا , ""Where is your cousin?"" She said, ""In the Mosque."" The Prophet (ﷺ) went to him and found that his (i.e. `Ali's) covering sheet had slipped of his back and dust had soiled his back. The Prophet (ﷺ) started wiping the dust off his back and said twice, ""Get up! O Abu Turab (i.e. O. man with the dust).",Companions of the Prophet,Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
3704,Narrated Sa`d bin 'Ubaida:,"A man came to Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما and asked about `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ and Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما mentioned his good deeds and said to the questioner. ""Perhaps these facts annoy you?"" The other said, ""Yes."" Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما said, ""May Allah stick your nose in the dust (i.e. degrade you)!' Then the man asked him about `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ . Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما mentioned his good deeds and said, ""It is all true, and that is his house in the midst of the houses of the Prophet. Perhaps these facts have hurt you?"" The questioner said, ""Yes."" Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما said, ""May Allah stick your nose in the dust (i.e. degrade you or make you do things which you hate) ! Go away and do whatever you can against me.""",Companions of the Prophet,Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
3705,Narrated `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Fatima رضی اللہ عنہا complained of the suffering caused to her by the hand mill. Some Captives were brought to the Prophet, she came to him but did not find him at home `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا was present there to whom she told (of her desire for a servant). When the Prophet (ﷺ) came, Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا informed him about Fatima's visit. `Ali added ""So the Prophet (ﷺ) came to us, while we had gone to our bed I wanted to get up but the Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Remain at your place"". Then he sat down between us till I found the coolness of his feet on my chest. Then he said, ""Shall I teach you a thing which is better than what you have asked me? When you go to bed, say, 'Allahu-Akbar' thirty-four times, and 'Subhan Allah thirty-three times, and 'Al hamdu-li l-lah thirty-three times for that is better for you both than a servant.""",Companions of the Prophet,Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih

In fact I used to keep close to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and was satisfied with what filled my stomach. I ate no leavened bread and dressed no decorated striped clothes, and never did a man or a woman serve me, and I often used to press my belly against gravel because of hunger, and I used to ask a man to recite a Qur'anic Verse to me although I knew it, so that he would take me to his home and feed me. And the most generous of all the people to the poor was Ja`far bin Abi Talib رضی اللہ عنہ . He used to take us to his home and offer us what was available therein.

She asked for the Sadaqa (i.e. wealth assigned for charitable purposes) of the Prophet (ﷺ) at Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus (i.e., one-fifth) of the Khaibar booty. Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'We (Prophets), our property is not inherited, and whatever we leave is Sadaqa, but Muhammad's Family can eat from this property, i.e. Allah's property, but they have no right to take more than the food they need.' By Allah! I will not bring any change in dealing with the Sadaqa of the Prophet (and will keep them) as they used to be observed in his (i.e. the Prophet's) life-time, and I will dispose with it as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to do,"" Then 'Ali رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle,"" and added, ""O Abu Bakr! We acknowledge your superiority."" Then he (i.e. 'Ali) mentioned their own relationship to Allah's Apostle and their right.
