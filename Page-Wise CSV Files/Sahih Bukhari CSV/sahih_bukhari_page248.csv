6443,Narrated Abu Dhar رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Once I went out at night and found Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) walking all alone accompanied by nobody, and I thought that perhaps he disliked that someone should accompany him. So I walked in the shade, away from the moonlight, but the Prophet (ﷺ) looked behind and saw me and said, ""Who is that?"" I replied, ""Abu Dhar, let Allah get me sacrificed for you!"" He said, ""O Abu Dhar, come here!"" So I accompanied him for a while and then he said, ""The rich are in fact the poor (little rewarded) on the Day of Resurrection except him whom Allah gives wealth which he gives (in charity) to his right, left, front and back, and does good deeds with it. I walked with him a little longer. Then he said to me, ""Sit down here."" So he made me sit in an open space surrounded by rocks, and said to me, ""Sit here till I come back to you."" He went towards Al-Harra till I could not see him, and he stayed away for a long period, and then I heard him saying, while he was coming, ""Even if he had committed theft, and even if he had committed illegal sexual intercourse?"" When he came, I could not remain patient and asked him, ""O Allah's Prophet! Let Allah get me sacrificed for you! Whom were you speaking to by the side of Al-Harra? I did not hear anybody responding to your talk."" He said, ""It was Gabriel who appeared to me beside Al-Harra and said, 'Give the good news to your followers that whoever dies without having worshipped anything besides Allah, will enter Paradise.' I said, 'O Gabriel! Even if he had committed theft or committed illegal sexual intercourse?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Even if he has committed theft or committed illegal sexual intercourse?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Even if he has committed theft or committed illegal sexual intercourse?' He said, 'Yes.' ""And though he imbibies.

6444,Narrated Abu Dhar رضی اللہ عنہ :,"While I was walking with the Prophet (ﷺ) in the Harra of Medina, Uhud came in sight. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""O Abu Dhar!"" I said, ""Labbaik, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!"" He said, ""I would not like to have gold equal to this mountain of Uhud, unless nothing of it, not even a single Dinar of it remains with me for more than three days, except something which I will keep for repaying debts. I would have spent all of it (distributed it) amongst Allah's Slaves like this, and like this, and like this."" The Prophet (ﷺ) pointed out with his hand towards his right, his left and his back (while illustrating it). He proceeded with his walk and said, ""The rich are in fact the poor (little rewarded) on the Day of Resurrection except those who spend their wealth like this, and like this, and like this, to their right, left and back, but such people are few in number."" Then he said to me, ""Stay at your place and do not leave it till I come back."" Then he proceeded in the darkness of the night till he went out of sight, and then I heard a loud voice, and was afraid that something might have happened to the Prophet (ﷺ) .1 intended to go to him, but I remembered what he had said to me, i.e. 'Don't leave your place till I come back to you,' so I remained at my place till he came back to me. I said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I heard a voice and I was afraid."" So I mentioned the whole story to him. He said, ""Did you hear it?"" I replied, ""Yes."" He said, ""It was Gabriel who came to me and said, 'Whoever died without joining others in worship with Allah, will enter Paradise.'

He replied, ""This (passer-by) is from the noble class of people. By Allah, if he should ask for a lady's hand in marriage, he ought to be given her in marriage, and if he intercedes for somebody, his intercession will be accepted. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept quiet, and then another man passed by and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked the same man (his companion) again, ""What is your opinion about this (second) one?"" He said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! This person is one of the poor Muslims. If he should ask a lady's hand in marriage, no-one will accept him, and if he intercedes for somebody, no one will accept his intercession, and if he talks, no-one will listen to his talk.""

6448,Narrated Khabbab رضی اللہ عنہ :,"""We migrated with the Prophet (ﷺ) for Allah's Sake and our wages became due on Allah. Some of us died without having received anything of the wages, and one of them was Mus`ab bin `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ , who was martyred on the day of the battle of Uhud, leaving only one sheet (to shroud him in). If we covered his head with it, his feet became uncovered, and if we covered his feet with it, his head became uncovered. So the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered us to cover his head with it and put some Idhkhir (a kind of grass) over his feet. On the other hand, some of us have had the fruits (of our good deed) and are plucking them (in this world).",To make the Heart Tender (Ar-Riqaq),Sahih Bukhari,8,Sahih

6452,Narrated Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ :,"By Allah except Whom none has the right to- be worshipped, (sometimes) I used to lay (sleep) on the ground on my liver (abdomen) because of hunger, and (sometimes) I used to bind a stone over my belly because of hunger. One day I sat by the way from where they (the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions) used to come out. When Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ passed by, I asked him about a Verse from Allah's Book and I asked him only that he might satisfy my hunger, but he passed by and did not do so. Then `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ passed by me and I asked him about a Verse from Allah's Book, and I asked him only that he might satisfy my hunger, but he passed by without doing so. Finally Abu-l-Qasim (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) passed by me and he smiled when he saw me, for he knew what was in my heart and on my face. He said, ""O Aba Hirr (Abu Huraira)!"" I replied, ""Labbaik, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!"" He said to me, ""Follow me."" He left and I followed him. Then he entered the house and I asked permission to enter and was admitted. He found milk in a bowl and said, ""From where is this milk?"" They said, ""It has been presented to you by such-and-such man (or by such and such woman)."" He said, ""O Aba Hirr!"" I said, ""Labbaik, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!"" He said, ""Go and call the people of Suffa to me."" These people of Suffa were the guests of Islam who had no families, nor money, nor anybody to depend upon, and whenever an object of charity was brought to the Prophet, he would send it to them and would not take anything from it, and whenever any present was given to him, he used to send some for them and take some of it for himself. The order of the Prophet upset me, and I said to myself, ""How will this little milk be enough for the people of As- Suffa? though I was more entitled to drink from that milk in order to strengthen myself"", but behold! The Prophet (ﷺ) came to order me to give that milk to them. I wondered what will remain of that milk for me, but anyway, I could not but obey Allah and His Apostle so I went to the people of As-Suffa and called them, and they came and asked the Prophet's permission to enter. They were admitted and took their seats in the house. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""O Aba-Hirr!"" I said, ""Labbaik, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!"" He said, ""Take it and give it to them."" So I took the bowl (of milk) and started giving it to one man who would drink his fill and return it to me, whereupon I would give it to another man who, in his turn, would drink his fill and return it to me, and I would then offer it to another man who would drink his fill and return it to me. Finally, after the whole group had drunk their fill, I reached the Prophet (ﷺ) who took the bowl and put it on his hand, looked at me and smiled and said. ""O Aba Hirr!"" I replied, ""Labbaik, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!"" He said, ""There remain you and I."" I said, ""You have said the truth, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!"" He said, ""Sit down and drink."" I sat down and drank. He said, ""Drink,"" and I drank. He kept on telling me repeatedly to drink, till I said, ""No. by Allah Who sent you with the Truth, I have no space for it (in my stomach)."" He said, ""Hand it over to me."" When I gave him the bowl, he praised Allah and pronounced Allah's Name on it and drank the remaining milk.",To make the Heart Tender (Ar-Riqaq),Sahih Bukhari,8,Sahih
6453,Narrated Sa`d رضی اللہ عنہ :,"I was the first man among the Arabs to throw an arrow for Allah's Cause. We used to fight in Allah's Cause while we had nothing to eat except the leaves of the Hubla and the Sumur trees (desert trees) so that we discharged excrement like that of sheep (i.e. unmixed droppings).
