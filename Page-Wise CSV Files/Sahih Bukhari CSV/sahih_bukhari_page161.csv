4194,Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa` رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Once I went (from Medina) towards (Al-Ghaba) before the first Adhan of the Fajr Prayer. The shecamels of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to graze at a place called Dhi-Qarad. A slave of `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf رضی اللہ عنہ met me (on the way) and said, ""The she-camels of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had been taken away by force."" I asked, ""Who had taken them?"" He replied ""(The people of) Ghatafan."" I made three loud cries (to the people of Medina) saying, ""O Sabahah!"" I made the people between the two mountains of Medina hear me. Then I rushed onward and caught up with the robbers while they were watering the camels. I started throwing arrows at them as I was a good archer and I was saying, ""I am the son of Al-Akwa`, and today will perish the wicked people."" I kept on saying like that till I restored the shecamels (of the Prophet), I also snatched thirty Burda (i.e. garments) from them. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) and the other people came there, and I said, ""O Allah's Prophet! I have stopped the people (of Ghatafan) from taking water and they are thirsty now. So send (some people) after them now."" On that the Prophet said, ""O the son of Al-Akwa`! You have over-powered them, so forgive them."" Then we all came back and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) seated me behind him on his she-camel till we entered Medina.",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4195,Narrated Suwaid bin An-Nu`man رضی اللہ عنہ :,"I went out in the company of the Prophet (ﷺ) in the year of Khaibar, and when we reached As Sahba' which is the lower part of Khaibar, the Prophet (ﷺ) offered the `Asr prayer and then asked the people to collect the journey food. Nothing was brought but Sawiq which the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered to be moistened with water, and then he ate it and we also ate it. Then he got up to offer the Maghrib prayer. He washed his mouth, and we too washed our mouths, and then he offered the prayer without repeating his abulution.",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
4196,Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa` رضی اللہ عنہ :,"We went out to Khaibar in the company of the Prophet. While we were proceeding at night, a man from the group said to 'Amir, ""O 'Amir! Won't you let us hear your poetry?"" 'Amir was a poet, so he got down and started reciting for the people poetry that kept pace with the camels' footsteps, saying:-- ""O Allah! Without You we Would not have been guided On the right path Neither would be have given In charity, nor would We have prayed. So please forgive us, what we have committed (i.e. our defects); let all of us Be sacrificed for Your Cause And send Sakina (i.e. calmness) Upon us to make our feet firm When we meet our enemy, and If they will call us towards An unjust thing, We will refuse. The infidels have made a hue and Cry to ask others' help Against us."" The Prophet (ﷺ) on that, asked, ""Who is that (camel) driver (reciting poetry)?"" The people said, ""He is 'Amir bin Al-Akwa` رضی اللہ عنہ ."" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""May Allah bestow His Mercy on him."" A man amongst the people said, ""O Allah's Prophet! has (martyrdom) been granted to him. Would that you let us enjoy his company longer."" Then we reached and besieged Khaibar till we were afflicted with severe hunger. Then Allah helped the Muslims conquer it (i.e. Khaibar). In the evening of the day of the conquest of the city, the Muslims made huge fires. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""What are these fires? For cooking what, are you making the fire?"" The people replied, ""(For cooking) meat."" He asked, ""What kind of meat?"" They (i.e. people) said, ""The meat of donkeys."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Throw away the meat and break the pots!"" Some man said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Shall we throw away the meat and wash the pots instead?"" He said, ""(Yes, you can do) that too."" So when the army files were arranged in rows (for the clash), 'Amir's sword was short and he aimed at the leg of a Jew to strike it, but the sharp blade of the sword returned to him and injured his own knee, and that caused him to die. When they returned from the battle, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw me (in a sad mood). He took my hand and said, ""What is bothering you?"" I replied, ""Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you! The people say that the deeds of 'Amir رضی اللہ عنہ are lost."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Whoever says so, is mistaken, for 'Amir has got a double reward."" The Prophet raised two fingers and added, ""He (i.e. Amir) was a persevering struggler in the Cause of Allah and there are few 'Arabs who achieved the like of (good deeds) 'Amir رضی اللہ عنہ had done."" Qotaibah has reported from Hatim that he ﷺ said: Such an Arab has not been born.",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
