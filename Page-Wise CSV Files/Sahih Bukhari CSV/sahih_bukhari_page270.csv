"7015, 7016",Narrated Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما :,"I saw in a dream a piece of silken cloth in my hand, and in whatever direction in Paradise I waved it, it flew, carrying me there.

7017,Narrated Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""When the Day of Resurrection approaches, the dreams of a believer will hardly fail to come true, and a dream of a believer is one of forty-six parts of prophetism, and whatever belongs to prothetism can never be false."" Muhammad bin Seereen said, ""But I say this."" He said, ""It used to be said, 'There are three types of dreams: The reflection of one's thoughts and experiences one has during wakefulness, what is suggested by Satan to frighten the dreamer, or glad tidings from Allah. So, if someone has a dream which he dislikes, he should not tell it to others, but get up and offer a prayer."" He added, ""He (Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ ) hated to see a Ghul (i.e., iron collar around his neck in a dream) and people liked to see fetters (on their feet in a dream). The fetters on the feet symbolizes one's constant and firm adherence to religion.""

Then we shrouded him in his clothes. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to us, I (addressing the dead body) said, ""May Allah's Mercy be on you, O Aba As-Sa'ib! I testify that Allah has honored you."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'How do you know that?' I replied, 'I do not know, by Allah.' He said, 'As for him, death has come to him and I wish him all good from Allah. By Allah, though I am Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), I neither know what will happen to me, nor to you.'"" Um Al-`Ala said, ""By Allah, I will never attest the righteousness of anybody after that."" She added, ""Later I saw in a dream, a flowing spring for `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہا `. So I went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and mentioned that to him.
