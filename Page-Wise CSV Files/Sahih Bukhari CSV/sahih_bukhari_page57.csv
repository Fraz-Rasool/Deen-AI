1460,Narrated Abu Dhar رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Once I went to him (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) and he said, ""By Allah in Whose Hands my life is (or probably said, 'By Allah, except Whom none has the right to be worshipped) whoever had camels or cows or sheep and did not pay their Zakat, those animals will be brought on the Day of Resurrection far bigger and fatter than before and they will tread him under their hooves, and will butt him with their horns, and (those animals will come in circle): When the last does its turn, the first will start again, and this punishment will go on till Allah has finished the judgments amongst the people.""

1461,Narrated Anas bin Malik :,"""Abu Talha رضی اللہ عنہ had more property of date-palm trees gardens than any other amongst the Ansar in Medina and the most beloved of them to him was Bairuha garden, and it was in front of the Mosque of the Prophet (ﷺ) . Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to go there and used to drink its nice water."" Anas added, ""When these verses were revealed:--'By no means shall you Attain righteousness unless You spend (in charity) of that Which you love. ' (3.92) Abu Talha said to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah, the Blessed, the Superior says: By no means shall you attain righteousness, unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love. And no doubt, Bairuha' garden is the most beloved of all my property to me. So I want to give it in charity in Allah's Cause. I expect its reward from Allah. O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Spend it where Allah makes you think it feasible.' On that Allah's Apostle said, 'Bravo! It is useful property. I have heard what you have said (O Abu Talha), and I think it would be proper if you gave it to your Kith and kin.' Abu Talha رضی اللہ عنہ said, I will do so, O Allah's Apostle.' Then Abu Talha رضی اللہ عنہ distributed that garden amongst his relatives and his cousins.""Ruh has followed this tradition with Abdullah bin Yusuf. Yahya bin Yahya and Isma'il quoted ""Raih"" (instead of ""Rabah"") for Malik.",Obligatory Charity Tax (Zakat),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1462,Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri رضی اللہ عنہ :,"On `Id ul Fitr or `Id ul Adha Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went out to the Musalla. After finishing the prayer, he delivered the sermon and ordered the people to give alms. He said, ""O people! Give alms."" Then he went towards the women and said. ""O women! Give alms, for I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-Fire were you (women)."" The women asked, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What is the reason for it?"" He replied, ""O women! You curse frequently, and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. O women, some of you can lead a cautious wise man astray."" Then he left. And when he reached his house, Zainab, the wife of Ibn Mas`ud, came and asked permission to enter It was said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! It is Zainab."" He asked, 'Which Zainab?"" The reply was that she was the wife of Ibn Mas'ub. He said, ""Yes, allow her to enter."" And she was admitted. Then she said, ""O Prophet of Allah! Today you ordered people to give alms and I had an ornament and intended to give it as alms, but Ibn Mas`ud said that he and his children deserved it more than anybody else."" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, ""Ibn Mas`ud had spoken the truth. Your husband and your children had more right to it than anybody else.""",Obligatory Charity Tax (Zakat),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih

1465,Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Once the Prophet (ﷺ) sat on a pulpit and we sat around him. Then he said, ""The things I am afraid of most for your sake (concerning what will befall you after me) is the pleasures and splendors of the world and its beauties which will be disclosed to you."" Somebody said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Can the good bring forth evil?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) remained silent for a while. It was said to that person, ""What is wrong with you? You are talking to the Prophet (p.b.u.h) while he is not talking to you."" Then we noticed that he was being inspired divinely. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) wiped off his sweat and said, ""Where is the questioner?"" It seemed as if the Prophet (ﷺ) liked his question. Then he said, ""Good never brings forth evil. Indeed it is like what grows on the banks of a water-stream which either kill or make the animals sick, except if an animal eats its fill the Khadira (a kind of vegetable) and then faces the sun, and then defecates and urinates and grazes again. No doubt this wealth is sweet and green. Blessed is the wealth of a Muslim from which he gives to the poor, the orphans and to needy travelers. (Or the Prophet said something similar to it) No doubt, whoever takes it illegally will be like the one who eats but is never satisfied, and his wealth will be a witness against him on the Day of Resurrection.""",Obligatory Charity Tax (Zakat),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1466,Narrated Zainab رضی اللہ عنہا :,"""I was in the Mosque and saw the Prophet (ﷺ) saying, 'O women ! Give alms even from your ornaments.' "" Zainab used to provide for `Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہ and those orphans who were under her protection. So she said to `Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہ , ""Will you ask Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) whether it will be sufficient for me to spend part of the Zakat on you and the orphans who are under my protection?"" He replied ""Will you yourself ask Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ?"" (Zainab added): So I went to the Prophet and I saw there an Ansari woman who was standing at the door (of the Prophet (ﷺ) ) with a similar problem as mine. Bilal رضی اللہ عنہ passed by us and we asked him, 'Ask the Prophet (ﷺ) whether it is permissible for me to spend (the Zakat) on my husband and the orphans under my protection.' And we requested Bilal رضی اللہ عنہ not to inform the Prophet (ﷺ) about us. So Bilal رضی اللہ عنہ went inside and asked the Prophet (ﷺ) regarding our problem. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked, ""Who are those two?"" Bilal رضی اللہ عنہ replied that she was Zainab. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Which Zainab?"" Bilal رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""The wife of `Abdullah (bin Mas`ud)."" The Prophet said, ""Yes, (it is sufficient for her) and she will receive a double rewards (for that): One for helping relatives, and the other for giving Zakat.""",Obligatory Charity Tax (Zakat),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1467,Narrated Zainab bint Um Salama:,"I said ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Shall I receive a reward if I spend for the sustenance of Abu Salama's offspring, and in fact they are also my sons?""

1468,Narrated Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered (a person) to collect Zakat, and that person returned and told him that Ibn Jamil, Khalid bin Al-Walid, and `Abbas bin `Abdul Muttalib had refused to give Zakat."" The Prophet said, ""What made Ibn Jamil refuse to give Zakat though he was a poor man, and was made wealthy by Allah and His Apostle ? But you are unfair in asking Zakat from Khalid as he is keeping his armor for Allah's Cause (for Jihad). As for `Abbas bin `Abdul Muttalib, he is the uncle of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and Zakat is compulsory on him and he should pay it double."" Abu Zinad corroborated him from his father. Ibn-e-Ishaq has reported from Abu Zinad: «هي عليه ومثلها معها» Ibn-e-Jurail said: Aaraj narrated to me the Hadith in the same way.",Obligatory Charity Tax (Zakat),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1469,Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:,"Some Ansari persons asked for (something) from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he gave them. They again asked him for (something) and he again gave them. And then they asked him and he gave them again till all that was with him finished. And then he said ""If I had anything. I would not keep it away from you. (Remember) Whoever abstains from asking others, Allah will make him contented, and whoever tries to make himself self-sufficient, Allah will make him self-sufficient. And whoever remains patient, Allah will make him patient. Nobody can be given a blessing better and greater than patience.""",Obligatory Charity Tax (Zakat),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1470,Narrated Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""By Him in Whose Hand my life is, it is better for anyone of you to take a rope and cut the wood (from the forest) and carry it over his back and sell it (as a means of earning his living) rather than to ask a person for something and that person may give him or not.""",Obligatory Charity Tax (Zakat),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih

1472,Narrated Hakim bin Hizam رضی اللہ عنہ :,"""(Once) I asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (for something) and he gave it to me. Again I asked and he gave (it to me). Again I asked and he gave (it to me). And then he said, ""O Hakim رضی اللہ عنہ ! This property is like a sweet fresh fruit; whoever takes it without greediness, he is blessed in it, and whoever takes it with greediness, he is not blessed in it, and he is like a person who eats but is never satisfied; and the upper (giving) hand is better than the lower (receiving) hand."" Hakim رضی اللہ عنہ added, ""I said to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) , 'By Him (Allah) Who sent you with the Truth, I shall never accept anything from anybody after you, till I leave this world.' "" Then Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ (during his caliphate) called Hakim to give him his share from the war booty (like the other companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) ), he refused to accept anything. Then `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ (during his caliphate) called him to give him his share but he refused. On that `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""O Muslims!

"1474, 1475",Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""A man keeps on asking others for something till he comes on the Day of Resurrection without any piece of flesh on his face.""

He will proceed on till he will hold the ring of the door (of Paradise) and then Allah will exalt him to Maqam Mahmud (the privilege of intercession, etc.).

Muala bin Asad said that Wahib narrated to us from Numan bin Rashid, from him Abdullah bin Muslim, the brother of Zuhri, from him Hamza bin Abdullah, and he heard from Abdullah bin Umar رضی اللہ عنہما , may Allah be pleased with him.

The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Or merely a Muslim (Who surrender to Allah)."" I remained quiet for a while but could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him. I said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Why have you left that person? By Allah! I consider him a believer. "" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Or merely a Muslim."" I remained quiet for a while but could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him. I said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Why have you left that person? By Allah!

Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""I give to a person while another is dearer to me, for fear that he may be thrown in the Hell-fire on his face (by reneging from Islam)."" Imam Bukhari said: ""فَكُبْكِبُوا‏"" means throw upside down.

"1481, 1482",Narrated Abu Humaid As-Sa`idi رضی اللہ عنہ :,"We took part in the holy battle of Tabuk in the company of the Prophet (ﷺ) and when we arrived at the Wadi-al-Qura, there was a woman in her garden. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked his companions to estimate the amount of the fruits in the garden, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) estimated it at ten Awsuq (One Wasaq = 60 Sa's) and 1 Sa'= 3 kg. approximately). The Prophet (ﷺ) said to that lady, ""Check what your garden will yield."" When we reached Tabuk, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""There will be a strong wind tonight and so no one should stand and whoever has a camel, should fasten it."" So we fastened our camels. A strong wind blew at night and a man stood up and he was blown away to a mountain called Taiy, The King of Aila sent a white mule and a sheet for wearing to the Prophet (ﷺ) as a present, and wrote to the Prophet (ﷺ) that his people would stay in their place (and will pay Jizya taxation.) (1) When the Prophet (ﷺ) reached Wadi-al- Qura he asked that woman how much her garden had yielded. She said, ""Ten Awsuq,"" and that was what Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had estimated. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""I want to reach Medina quickly, and whoever among you wants to accompany me, should hurry up."" The sub-narrator Ibn Bakkar said something which meant: When the Prophet (ﷺ) saw Medina he said, ""This is Taba."" And when he saw the mountain of Uhud, he said, ""This mountain loves us and we love it. Shall I tell you of the best amongst the Ansar?"" They replied in the affirmative. He said, ""The family of Bani-n-Najjar, and then the family of Bani Sa`ida or Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj. (The above-mentioned are the best) but there is goodness in all the families of Ansar."" Abu Abdullah (Qasim bin Salam) said that a garden surrounded by a wall will be called a garden. And the one that does not have a wall around it will not be called a garden. Amara bin Ghazniyyah said to him that his father Abbas (Sahil) said that the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: Uhud is the mountain that loves us and we love it.",Obligatory Charity Tax (Zakat),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
1483,Narrated Salim bin `Abdullah from his father:,"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""On a land irrigated by rain water or by natural water channels or if the land is wet due to a near by water channel Ushr (i.e. one-tenth) is compulsory (as Zakat); and on the land irrigated by the well, half of an Ushr (i.e. one-twentieth) is compulsory (as Zakat on the yield of the land)."" Imam Abu Abdullah Bukhari said: This is the interpretation of the previous Hadith for it is in Ibn for it is in Ibe-e-Umer's Hadith: a tenth on which is watered by rain and there is certainty, and it has been illustrated and such an addition is acceptable, and a self exclamatory Hadith clarifies an abridged Hadith when it has been reported by Huffaz; such as, Hadrat Fadl bin Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ has reported that the Prophet (ﷺ) did not perform any prayer inside the Kabah, whereas Hadrat Bilal رضی اللہ عنہ has said that he performed. So, Hadrat Bilal's saying was accepted and Hadrat Fadl's saying was forsaken.",Obligatory Charity Tax (Zakat),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih

1485,Narrated Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Dates used to be brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) immediately after being plucked.

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) looked at him and took it out from his mouth and said, ""Don't you know that Muhammad's offspring do not eat what is given in charity?""",Obligatory Charity Tax (Zakat),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
