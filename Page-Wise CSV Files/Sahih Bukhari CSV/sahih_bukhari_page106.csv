2759,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"Some people claim that the order in the above Verse is cancelled, by Allah, it is not cancelled, but the people have stopped acting on it. There are two kinds of guardians (who are in charge of the inheritance): One is that who inherits; such a person should give (of what he inherits to the relatives, the orphans and the needy, etc.), the other is that who does not inherit (e.g. the guardian of the orphans): such a person should speak kindly and say (to those who are present at the time of distribution), ""I can not give it to you (as the wealth belongs to the orphans).",Wills and Testaments (Wasaayaa),Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih

2763,Narrated `Urwa bin Az-Zubai رضی اللہ عنہ :,"`Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا about the meaning of the Qur'anic Verse:-- ""And if you fear that you will not deal fairly with the orphan girls then marry (other) women of your choice."" (4.2-3) Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا said, ""It is about a female orphan under the guardianship of her guardian who is inclined towards her because of her beauty and wealth, and likes to marry her with a Mahr less than what is given to women of her standard. So they (i.e. guardians) were forbidden to marry the orphans unless they paid them a full appropriate Mahr (otherwise) they were ordered to marry other women instead of them. Later on the people asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about it. So Allah revealed the following Verse:-- ""They ask your instruction (O Muhammad!) regarding women. Say: Allah instructs you regarding them..."" (4.127) and in this Verse Allah indicated that if the orphan girl was beautiful and wealthy, her guardian would have the desire to marry her without giving her an appropriate Mahr equal to what her peers could get, but if she was undesirable for lack of beauty or wealth, then he would not marry her, but seek to marry some other woman instead of her. So, since he did not marry her when he had no inclination towards her, he had not the right to marry her when he had an interest in her, unless he treated her justly by giving her a full Mahr and securing all her rights.",Wills and Testaments (Wasaayaa),Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih
2764,Narrated Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما :,"In the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) , `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ gave in charity some of his property, a garden of date-palms called Thamgh. `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have some property which I prize highly and I want to give it in charity."" The Prophet; said, ""Give it in charity (i.e. as an endowment) with its land and trees on the condition that the land and trees will neither be sold nor given as a present, nor bequeathed, but the fruits are to be spent in charity."" So `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ gave it in charity, and it was for Allah's Cause, the emancipation of slaves, for the poor, for guests, for travelers, and for kinsmen. The person acting as its administrator could eat from it reasonably and fairly, and could let a friend of his eat from it provided he had no intention of becoming wealthy by its means.",Wills and Testaments (Wasaayaa),Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih
2765,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"The following Verse:-- ""If a guardian is well-off, let him claim no remuneration (i.e. wages), but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable.""

2767,Narrated Nafi' said:,"""Ibn 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہما never refused to be appointed as guardian."" The most beloved thing to Ibn Sirin concerning an orphan's wealth was that the orphan's advisor and guardians would assemble to decide what is best for him. When Tawus was asked about something concerning an orphan's affairs, he would recite: '...And Allah knows him who means mischief from him who means good...' (V 2:220). 'Ata said concerning some orphans, ""The guardian is to provide for the young and the old orphans according to their needs from their shares.""",Wills and Testaments (Wasaayaa),Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih
2768,Narrated Anas رضی اللہ عنہ :,"When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to Medina; he did not have any servant.

When the following Divine Verse came:-- ""By no means shall you attain piety until you spend of what you love,"" (3.92) Abu Talha got up saying. ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah says, 'You will not attain piety until you spend of what you love,' and I prize above al I my wealth, Bairuha' which I want to give in charity for Allah's Sake, hoping for its reward from Allah. So you can use it as Allah directs you."" On that the Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Bravo! It is a profitable (or perishable) property. (Ibn Maslama is not sure as to which word is right, i.e. profitable or perishable.) I have heard what you have said, and I recommend that you distribute this amongst your relatives."" On that Abu Talha said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I will do (as you have suggested)."" So, Abu Talha distributed that garden amongst his relatives and cousins.
