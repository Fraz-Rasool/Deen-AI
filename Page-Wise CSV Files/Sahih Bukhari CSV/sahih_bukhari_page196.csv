5102,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) entered upon her while a man was sitting with her. Signs of answer seemed to appear on his face as if he disliked that. She said, ""Here is my (foster) brother."" He said, ""Be sure as to who is your foster brother, for foster suckling relationship is established only when milk is the only food of the child.""","Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah)",Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih
5103,Narrated Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"Aflah the brother of Abu Al-Qu'ais, her foster uncle, came, asking permission to enter upon her after the Verse of Al-Hijab (the use of veils by women) was revealed. `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا added: I did not allow him to enter, but when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came, I told him what I had done, and he ordered me to give him permission.","Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah)",Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih
5104,Narrated `Uqba bin Al-Harith رضی اللہ عنہ :,"I married a woman and then a black lady came to us and said, ""I have suckled you both (you and your wife)."" So I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, ""I married so-and-so and then a black lady came to us and said to me, 'I have suckled both of you.' But I think she is a liar."" The Prophet (ﷺ) turned his face away from me and I moved to face his face, and said, ""She is a liar."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""How (can you keep her as your wife) when that lady has said that she has suckled both of you? So abandon (i.e., divorce) her (your wife). Ismail said it indicating with his two fingers, the forefinger and the middle finger that Ayyub Sakhtiyani would narrate it in this way.","Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah)",Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih
5105,Narrated Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"""Seven types of marriages are unlawful because of blood relations, and seven because of marriage relations."" Then Ibn 'Abbas recited the Verse: ""Forbidden for you (for marriages) are your mothers..."" (4:23). 'Abdullah bin Ja'far married the daughter and wife of 'Ali رضی اللہ عنہ at the same time (they were step-daughter and mother). Ibn Sirin said, ""There is no harm in that."" But Al-Hasan Al-Basri disapproved of it at first, but then said that there was no harm in it. Al-Hasan bin Al-Hasan bin 'Ali married two of his cousins in one night. Ja'far bin Zaid disapproved of that because of it would bring hatred (between the two cousins), but it is not unlawful, as Allah said, ""Lawful to you are all others [beyond those (mentioned)]. (4:24). Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما said: ""If somebody commits illegal sexual intercourse with his wife's sister, his wife does not become unlawful for him."" And narrated Abu Ja'far, ""If a person commits homosexuality with a boy, then the mother of that boy is unlawful for him to marry."" Narrated Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما , ""If one commits illegal sexual intercourse with his mother in law, then his married relation to his wife does not become unlawful."" Abu Nasr reported to have said that Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما in the above case, regarded his marital relation to his wife unlawful, but Abu Nasr is not known well for hearing Hadith from Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما . Imran bin Hussain, Jabir b. Zaid, Al-Hasan and some other Iraqi's, are reported to have judged that his marital relations to his wife would be unlawful. In the above case Abu Hurairah رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""The marital relation to one's wife does not become unlawful except if one as had sexual intercourse (with her mother)."" Ibn Al-Musaiyab, 'Urwa, and Az-Zuhri allows such person to keep his wife. 'Ali رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""His marital relations to his wife does not become unlawful.""","Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah)",Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih

He said, ""Do you like that?"" I said, ""(Yes), for even now I am not your only wife, so I like that my sister should share you with me."" He said, ""She is not lawful for me (to marry)."" I said, ""We have heard that you want to marry."" He said, ""The daughter of Um Salama?"" I said, ""Yes."" He said, ""Even if she were not my stepdaughter, she should be unlawful for me to marry, for Thuwaiba suckled me and her father (Abu Salama). So you should neither present your daughters, nor your sisters, to me."" Laith has said with reference to Hisham that her name was Durrah, the daughter of abu Salamah.","Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah)",Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih
5107,Narrated Um Habiba رضی اللہ عنہا :,"I said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Marry my sister, the daughter of Abu Sufyan."" He said, ""Do you like that?""

Az-Zuhri (the sub-narrator) said: There is a similar order for the paternal aunt of the father of one's wife, for 'Urwa told me that `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا said, ""What is unlawful because of blood relations, is also unlawful because of the corresponding foster suckling relations.""","Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah)",Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih
5112,Narrated Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbade Ash-Shighar, which means that somebody marries his daughter to somebody else, and the latter marries his daughter to the former without paying Mahr.","Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah)",Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih

5120,Narrated Thabit Al-Banani:,"I was with Anas رضی اللہ عنہ while his daughter was present with him.

The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""What will she do with your waist sheet? If you wear it, she will have nothing over her; and if she wears it, you will have nothing over you.""

I went to `Uthman bin `Affan رضی اللہ عنہ and presented Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا (for marriage) to him. He said, ""I will think it over.' I waited for a few days, then he met me and said, 'It seems that it is not possible for me to marry at present.'

Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ kept quiet and did not say anything to me in reply. I became more angry with him than with `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہا . I waited for a few days and then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked for her hand, and I gave her in marriage to him. Afterwards I met Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ who said, 'Perhaps you became angry with me when you presented Hafsa to me and I did not give you a reply?' I said, 'Yes.' Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, 'Nothing stopped me to respond to your offer except that I knew that Allah's Apostle had mentioned her, and I never wanted to let out the secret of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). And if Allah's Apostle had refused her, I would have accepted her.' ""","Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah)",Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih

5124,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"""Hint your intention of marrying' is made by saying (to the widow) for example: ""I want to marry, and I wish that Allah will make a righteous lady available for me.' "" Al-Qasim said: One may say to the widow: 'I hold all respect for you, and I am interested in you; Allah will bring you much good, or something similar 'Ata said: One should hint his intention, and should not declare it openly. One may say: 'I have some need. Have good tidings. Praise be to Allah; you are fit to remarry.' She (the widow) may say in reply: I am listening to what you say,' but she should not make a promise. Her guardian should not make a promise (to somebody to get her married to him) without her knowledge. But if, while still in the Iddat period, she makes a promise to marry somebody, and he ultimately marries her, they are not to be separated by divorce (i.e., the marriage is valid). Hadrat Hasan Basri says: ''‏لاَ تُوَاعِدُوهُنَّ سِرًّا ‏ '' means adultery. And it is reported from Hadrat Ibn-e-Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما that '' الْكِتَابُ أَجَلَهُ‏ '' means the completion of the prescribed waiting period.","Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah)",Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih

'If it is from Allah, then it will surely be.' ""","Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah)",Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih
5126,Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d رضی اللہ عنہ :,"A woman came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have come to you to present myself to you (for marriage)."" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) glanced at her. He looked at her carefully and fixed his glance on her and then lowered his head. When the lady saw that he did not say anything, she sat down. A man from his companions got up and said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! If you are not in need of her, then marry her to me."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Have you got anything to offer."" The man said, 'No, by Allah, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!"" The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), ""Go to your family and try to find something."" So the man went and returned, saying, ""No, by Allah, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have not found anything."" The Prophet said, ""Go again and look for something, even if it were an iron ring."" He went and returned, saying, ""No, by Allah, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I could not find even an iron ring, but this is my Izar (waist sheet).' He had no Rida (upper garment).

If you wear it, she will have nothing over herself thereof (will be naked); and if she wears it, then you will have nothing over yourself thereof ' So the man sat for a long period and then got up (to leave).

The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Go I let you marry her for what you know of the Qur'an (as her Mahr).","Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah)",Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih
5127,Narrated 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair:,"Aishah رضی اللہ عنہا , the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) told him that there were four types of marriage during Pre-Islamic period of Ignorance. One type was similar to that of the present day i.e. a man used to ask somebody else for the hand of a girl under his guardianship or for his daughter's hand, and give her Mahr and then marry her. The second type was that a man would say to his wife after she had become clean from her period. ""Send for so-and-so and have sexual intercourse with him."" Her husband would then keep awy from her and would never sleep with her till she got pregnant from the other man with whom she was sleeping. When her pregnancy became evident, he husband would sleep with her if he wished. Her husband did so (i.e. let his wife sleep with some other man) so that he might have a child of noble breed. Such marriage was called as Al-Istibda'. Another type of marriage was that a group of less than ten men would assemble and enter upon a woman, and all of them would have sexual relation with her. If she became pregnant and delivered a child and some days had passed after delivery, she would sent for all of them and none of them would refuse to come, and when they all gathered before her, she would say to them, ""You (all) know waht you have done, and now I have given birth to a child. So, it is your child so-and-so!"" naming whoever she liked, and her child would follow him and he could not refuse to take him. The fourth type of marriage was that many people would enter upon a lady and she would never refuse anyone who came to her. Those were the prostitutes who used to fix flags at their doors as sign, and he who would wished, could have sexual intercourse with them. If anyone of them got pregnant and delivered a child, then all those men would be gathered for her and they would call the Qa'if (persons skilled in recognizing the likeness of a child to his father) to them and would let the child follow the man (whom they recognized as his father) and she would let him adhere to him and be called his son. The man would not refuse all that. But when Muhammad (ﷺ) was sent with the Truth, he abolished all the types of marriages observed in pre-Islamic period of Ignorance except the type of marriage the people recognize today.","Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah)",Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih
5128,Narrated `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"(as regards the Verse): 'And about what is recited unto you in the Book, concerning orphan girls to whom you give not the prescribed portions and yet, whom you desire to marry.' (4.127) This Verse is about the female orphan who is under the guardianship of a man with whom she shares her property and he has more right over her (than anybody else) but does not like to marry her, so he prevents her, from marrying somebody else, lest he should share the property with him.","Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah)",Sahih Bukhari,7,Sahih
