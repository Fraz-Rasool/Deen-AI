When that man saw that Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما did not agree to his proposal, he said, ""What is your opinion regarding `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ and `Uthman?"" Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما said, ""What is my opinion regarding `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ and `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ?

Nevertheless, he considers himself to be superior to me and does not want me to be one of his friends.

Do you offer the prayer for Ibn Ubai although he said so-and-so on such-and-such-a day?"" I went on mentioning his sayings. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiled and said, ""Keep away from me, O `Umar!"" But when I spoke too much to him, he said, ""I have been given the choice, and I have chosen (this) ; and if I knew that if I asked forgiveness for him more than seventy times, he would be for given, I would ask it for more times than that."" So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) offered the funeral prayer for him and then left, but he did not stay long before the two Verses of Surat-Bara'a were revealed, i.e.:-- 'And never (O Muhammad) pray for anyone of them that dies.... and died in a state of rebellion.'
