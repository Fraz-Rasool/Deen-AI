Then the same man added, ""I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me than the meat of two sheep."" The Prophet (ﷺ) permitted him to slaughter it as a sacrifice.

955,Narrated Al-Bara' bin `Azib رضی اللہ عنہما :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) delivered the Khutba after offering the prayer on the Day of Nahr and said, ""Whoever offers the prayer like us and slaughters like us then his Nusuk (sacrifice) will be accepted by Allah. And whoever slaughters his sacrifice before the `Id prayer then he has not done the sacrifice."" Abi Burda bin Niyar, the uncle of Al-Bara' said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have slaughtered my sheep before the `Id prayer and I thought today as a day of eating and drinking (not alcoholic drinks), and I liked that my sheep should be the first to be slaughtered in my house. So slaughtered my sheep and took my food before coming for the prayer."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""The sheep which you have slaughtered is just mutton (not a Nusuk)."" He (Abu Burda) said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me than two sheep. Will that be sufficient as a Nusuk on my behalf?

956,Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) used to proceed to the Musalla on the days of Id-ul-Fitr and Id-ul-Adha; the first thing to begin with was the prayer and after that he would stand in front of the people and the people would keep sitting in their rows. Then he would preach to them, advise them and give them orders, (i.e. Khutba). And after that if he wished to send an army for an expedition, he would do so; or if he wanted to give and order, he would do so, and then depart. The people followed this tradition till I went out with Marwan, the Governor of Medina, for the prayer of Id-ul-Adha or Id-ul-Fitr. When we reached the Musalla, there was a pulpit made by Kathir bin As-Salt. Marwan wanted to get up on that pulpit before the prayer. I got hold of his clothes but he pulled them and ascended the pulpit and delivered the Khutba before the prayer. I said to him, ""By Allah, you have changed (the Prophet's tradition)."" He replied, ""O Abu Sa`id! Gone is that which you know."" I said, ""By Allah! What I know is better than what I do not know."" Marwan said, ""People do not sit to listen to our Khutba after the prayer, so I delivered the Khutba before the prayer.""",The Two Festivals (Eids),Sahih Bukhari,2,Sahih
