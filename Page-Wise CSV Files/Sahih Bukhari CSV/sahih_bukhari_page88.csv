2291,Narrated Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""An Israeli man asked another Israeli to lend him one thousand Dinars. The second man required witnesses. The former replied, 'Allah is sufficient as a witness.' The second said, 'I want a surety.' The former replied, 'Allah is sufficient as a surety.' The second said, 'You are right,' and lent him the money for a certain period. The debtor went across the sea. When he finished his job, he searched for a conveyance so that he might reach in time for the repayment of the debt, but he could not find any. So, he took a piece of wood and made a hole in it, inserted in it one thousand Dinars and a letter to the lender and then closed (i.e. sealed) the hole tightly. He took the piece of wood to the sea and said. 'O Allah! You know well that I took a loan of one thousand Dinars from so-and-so. He demanded a surety from me but I told him that Allah's Guarantee was sufficient and he accepted Your guarantee. He then asked for a witness and I told him that Allah was sufficient as a Witness, and he accepted You as a Witness. No doubt, I tried hard to find a conveyance so that I could pay his money but could not find, so I hand over this money to You.' Saying that, he threw the piece of wood into the sea till it went out far into it, and then he went away. Meanwhile he started searching for a conveyance in order to reach the creditor's country. One day the lender came out of his house to see whether a ship had arrived bringing his money, and all of a sudden he saw the piece of wood in which his money had been deposited. He took it home to use for fire. When he sawed it, he found his money and the letter inside it. Shortly after that, the debtor came bringing one thousand Dinars to him and said, 'By Allah, I had been trying hard to get a boat so that I could bring you your money, but failed to get one before the one I have come by.' The lender asked, 'Have you sent something to me?' The debtor replied, 'I have told you I could not get a boat other than the one I have come by.' The lender said, 'Allah has delivered on your behalf the money you sent in the piece of wood. So, you may keep your one thousand Dinars and depart guided on the right path.'

2297,Narrated Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"Since I reached the age when I could remember things, I have seen my parents worshipping according to the right faith of Islam. Not a single day passed but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) visited us both in the morning and in the evening. When the Muslims were persecuted, Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ set out for Ethiopia as an emigrant. When he reached a place called Bark-al-Ghimad, he met Ibn Ad-Daghna, the chief of the Qara tribe, who asked Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ , ""Where are you going?"" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""My people have turned me out of the country and I would like to tour the world and worship my Lord."" Ibn Ad- Daghna said, ""A man like you will not go out, nor will he be turned out as you help the poor earn their living, keep good relation with your Kith and kin, help the disabled (or the dependents), provide guests with food and shelter, and help people during their troubles. I am your protector. So, go back and worship your Lord at your home."" Ibn Ad-Daghna went along with Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ and took him to the chiefs of Quraish saying to them, ""A man like Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ will not go out, nor will he be turned out. Do you turn out a man who helps the poor earn their living, keeps good relations with Kith and kin, helps the disabled, provides guests with food and shelter, and helps the people during their troubles?"" So, Quraish allowed Ibn Ad-Daghna's guarantee of protection and told Abu- Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ that he was secure, and said to Ibn Ad-Daghna, ""Advise Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ to worship his Lord in his house and to pray and read what he liked and not to hurt us and not to do these things publicly, for we fear that our sons and women may follow him."" Ibn Ad-Daghna told Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ of all that, so Abu- Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ continued worshipping his Lord in his house and did not pray or recite Qur'an aloud except in his house. Later on Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ had an idea of building a mosque in the court yard of his house. He fulfilled that idea and started praying and reciting Qur'an there publicly. The women and the offspring of the pagans started gathering around him and looking at him astonishingly. Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ was a softhearted person and could not help weeping while reciting Qur'an. This horrified the pagan chiefs of Quraish. They sent for Ibn Ad-Daghna and when he came, they said, ""We have given Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ protection on condition that he will worship his Lord in his house, but he has transgressed that condition and has built a mosque in the court yard of his house and offered his prayer and recited Qur'an in public. We are afraid lest he mislead our women and offspring. So, go to him and tell him that if he wishes he can worship his Lord in his house only, and if not, then tell him to return your pledge of protection as we do not like to betray you by revoking your pledge, nor can we tolerate Abu Bakr's public declaration of Islam (his worshipping). `Aisha added: Ibn Ad-Daghna came to Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ and said, ""You know the conditions on which I gave you protection, so you should either abide by those conditions or revoke my protection, as I do not like to hear the 'Arabs saying that Ibn Ad-Daghna gave the pledge of protection to a person and his people did not respect it."" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I revoke your pledge of protection and am satisfied with Allah's protection."" At that time Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was still in Mecca and he said to his companions, ""Your place of emigration has been shown to me. I have seen salty land, planted with date-palms and situated between two mountains which are the two ,Harras."" So, when the Prophet (ﷺ) told it, some of the companions migrated to Medina, and some of those who had migrated to Ethiopia returned to Medina. When Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ prepared for emigration, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him, ""Wait, for I expect to be permitted to emigrate."" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ asked, ""May my father be sacrificed for your sake, do you really expect that?"" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied in the affirmative. So, Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ postponed his departure in order to accompany Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and fed two camels which he had, with the leaves of Samor trees for four months.",Kafalah,Sahih Bukhari,3,Sahih
2298,Narrated Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Whenever a dead man in debt was brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) he would ask, ""Has he left anything to repay his debt?"" If he was informed that he had left something to repay his debts, he would offer his funeral prayer, otherwise he would tell the Muslims to offer their friend's funeral prayer. When Allah made the Prophet (ﷺ) wealthy through conquests, he said, ""I am more rightful than other believers to be the guardian of the believers, so if a Muslim dies while in debt, I am responsible for the repayment of his debt, and whoever leaves wealth (after his death) it will belong to his heirs. """,Kafalah,Sahih Bukhari,3,Sahih
