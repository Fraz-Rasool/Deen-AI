2698,Narrated Al-Bara bin `Azib رضی اللہ عنہ :,"When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) concluded a peace treaty with the people of Hudaibiya, `Ali bin Abu Talib wrote the document and he mentioned in it, ""Muhammad, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ."" The pagans said, ""Don't write: 'Muhammad, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)', for if you were an apostle we would not fight with you."" Allah's Apostle asked `Ali to rub it out, but `Ali said, ""I will not be the person to rub it out."" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) rubbed it out and made peace with them on the condition that the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions would enter Mecca and stay there for three days, and that they would enter with their weapons in cases. So, he was asked what was the meaning of جلبان السلاح? He said: A leather casing and what is inside it.",Peacemaking,Sahih Bukhari,3,Sahih
2699,Narrated Al-Bara رضی اللہ عنہ :,"When the Prophet (ﷺ) intended to perform `Umra in the month of Dhul-Qada, the people of Mecca did not let him enter Mecca till he settled the matter with them by promising to stay in it for three days only. When the document of treaty was written, the following was mentioned: 'These are the terms on which Muhammad, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) agreed (to make peace).' They said, ""We will not agree to this, for if we believed that you are Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) we would not prevent you, but you are Muhammad bin `Abdullah."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""I am Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and also Muhammad bin `Abdullah."" Then he said to `Ali, ""Rub off (the words) 'Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)' "", but `Ali said, ""No, by Allah, I will never rub off your name."" So, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) took the document and wrote, 'This is what Muhammad bin `Abdullah has agreed upon: No arms will be brought into Mecca except in their cases, and nobody from the people of Mecca will be allowed to go with him (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ) even if he wished to follow him and he (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) will not prevent any of his companions from staying in Mecca if the latter wants to stay.' When the Prophet (ﷺ) entered Mecca and the time limit passed, the Meccans went to `Ali and said, ""Tell your Friend (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ) to go out, as the period (agreed to) has passed."" So, the Prophet (ﷺ) went out of Mecca. The daughter of Hamza ran after them (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions), calling, ""O Uncle! O Uncle!"" `Ali received her and led her by the hand and said to Fatima, ""Take your uncle's daughter."" Zaid and Ja`far quarreled about her. `Ali said, ""I have more right to her as she is my uncle's daughter."" Ja`far said, ""She is my uncle's daughter, and her aunt is my wife."" Zaid said, ""She is my brother's daughter."" The Prophet (ﷺ) judged that she should be given to her aunt, and said that the aunt was like the mother. He then said to 'All, ""You are from me and I am from you"", and said to Ja`far, ""You resemble me both in character and appearance"", and said to Zaid, ""You are our brother (in faith) and our freed slave.""",Peacemaking,Sahih Bukhari,3,Sahih

No, by Him Who has sent you with the Truth, her tooth will not be broken."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""O Anas! Allah""; law ordains retaliation."" Later the relatives of the girl agreed and forgave her.

Muawiya رضی اللہ عنہ who was really the best of the two men said to him, ""O `Amr! If these killed those and those killed these, who would be left with me for the jobs of the public, who would be left with me for their women, who would be left with me for their children?"" Then Muawiya رضی اللہ عنہ sent two Quraishi men from the tribe of `Abd-i-Shams called `Abdur Rahman bin Sumura and `Abdullah bin 'Amir bin Kuraiz to Al-Hasan saying to them, ""Go to this man (i.e. Al-Hasan) and negotiate peace with him and talk and appeal to him."" So, they went to Al-Hasan and talked and appealed to him to accept peace. Al-Hasan said, ""We, the offspring of `Abdul Muttalib, have got wealth and people have indulged in killing and corruption (and money only will appease them)."" They said to Al-Hasan, ""Muawiya رضی اللہ عنہ offers you so and so, and appeals to you and entreats you to accept peace."" Al-Hasan said to them, ""But who will be responsible for what you have said?"" They said, ""We will be responsible for it."" So, whatever Al- Hasan asked they said, ""We will be responsible for it for you."" So, Al-Hasan concluded a peace treaty with Muawiya رضی اللہ عنہ . Al-Hasan (Al-Basri) said: I heard Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ saying, ""I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on the pulpit and Al-Hasan bin `Ali was by his side. The Prophet (ﷺ) was looking once at the people and once at Al-Hasan bin `Ali saying, 'This son of mine is a Saiyid (i.e. a noble) and may Allah make peace between two big groups of Muslims through him.""

So, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ his full right. Before that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had given a generous judgment beneficial for Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ and the Ansari, but when the Ansan irritated Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) he gave Az-Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ his full right according to the evident law.

So, I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and told him about it. He said (to me), ""When you pluck the dates and collect them in the Mirbad (i.e. a place where dates are dried), call me (Allah's Messenger (ﷺ))."" Finally he came accompanied by Abu Bakr and `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ and sat on the dates and invoked Allah to bless them. Then he said, ""Call your creditors and give them their full rights."" So, I paid all my father's creditors in full and yet thirteen extra Wasqs of dates remained, seven of which were 'Ajwa and six were Laun or six of which were Ajwa and seven were Laun. I met Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) at sunset and informed him about it. On that he smiled and said, ""Go to Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ and `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ and tell them about it.""
