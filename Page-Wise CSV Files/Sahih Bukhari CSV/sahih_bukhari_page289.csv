7517,Narrated Anas bin Malik رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The night Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was taken for a journey from the sacred mosque (of Mecca) Al-Ka`ba: Three persons came to him (in a dreamy while he was sleeping in the Sacred Mosque before the Divine Inspiration was revealed to Him. One of them said, ""Which of them is he?"" The middle (second) angel said, ""He is the best of them."" The last (third) angle said, ""Take the best of them."" Only that much happened on that night and he did not see them till they came on another night, i.e. after The Divine Inspiration was revealed to him. (Fath-ul-Bari Page 258, Vol. 17) and he saw them, his eyes were asleep but his heart was not----and so is the case with the prophets: their eyes sleep while their hearts do not sleep. So those angels did not talk to him till they carried him and placed him beside the well of Zamzam. From among them Gabriel took charge of him. Gabriel cut open (the part of his body) between his throat and the middle of his chest (heart) and took all the material out of his chest and `Abdomen and then washed it with Zamzam water with his own hands till he cleansed the inside of his body, and then a gold tray containing a gold bowl full of belief and wisdom was brought and then Gabriel stuffed his chest and throat blood vessels with it and then closed it (the chest). He then ascended with him to the heaven of the world and knocked on one of its doors. The dwellers of the Heaven asked, 'Who is it?' He said, ""Gabriel."" They said, ""Who is accompanying you?"" He said, ""Muhammad."" They said, ""Has he been called?"" He said, ""Yes"" They said, ""He is welcomed."" So the dwellers of the Heaven became pleased with his arrival, and they did not know what Allah would do to the Prophet (ﷺ) on earth unless Allah informed them. The Prophet (ﷺ) met Adam over the nearest Heaven. Gabriel said to the Prophet, ""He is your father; greet him."" The Prophet (ﷺ) greeted him and Adam returned his greeting and said, ""Welcome, O my Son! O what a good son you are!"" Behold, he saw two flowing rivers, while he was in the nearest sky. He asked, ""What are these two rivers, O Gabriel?"" Gabriel said, ""These are the sources of the Nile and the Euphrates."" Then Gabriel took him around that Heaven and behold, he saw another river at the bank of which there was a palace built of pearls and emerald. He put his hand into the river and found its mud like musk Adhfar. He asked, ""What is this, O Gabriel?"" Gabriel said, ""This is the Kauthar which your Lord has kept for you."" Then Gabriel ascended (with him) to the second Heaven and the angels asked the same questions as those on the first Heaven, i.e., ""Who is it?"" Gabriel replied, ""Gabriel"". They asked, ""Who is accompanying you?"" He said, ""Muhammad."" They asked, ""Has he been sent for?"" He said, ""Yes."" Then they said, ""He is welcomed.'' Then he (Gabriel) ascended with the Prophet (ﷺ) to the third Heaven, and the angels said the same as the angels of the first and the second Heavens had said. Then he ascended with him to the fourth Heaven and they said the same; and then he ascended with him to the fifth Heaven and they said the same; and then he ascended with him to the sixth Heaven and they said the same; then he ascended with him to the seventh Heaven and they said the same. On each Heaven there were prophets whose names he had mentioned and of whom I remember Idris on the second Heaven, Aaron on the fourth Heavens another prophet whose name I don't remember, on the fifth Heaven, Abraham on the sixth Heaven, and Moses on the seventh Heaven because of his privilege of talking to Allah directly. Moses said (to Allah), ""O Lord! I thought that none would be raised up above me."" But Gabriel ascended with him (the Prophet) for a distance above that, the distance of which only Allah knows, till he reached the Lote Tree (beyond which none may pass) and then the Irresistible, the Lord of Honor and Majesty approached and came closer till he (Gabriel) was about two bow lengths or (even) nearer. (It is said that it was Gabriel who approached and came closer to the Prophet. (Fate Al-Bari Page 263, 264, Vol. 17). Among the things which Allah revealed to him then, was: ""Fifty prayers were enjoined on his followers in a day and a night."" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) descended till he met Moses, and then Moses stopped him and asked, ""O Muhammad ! What did your Lord en join upon you?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied,"" He enjoined upon me to perform fifty prayers in a day and a night."" Moses said, ""Your followers cannot do that; Go back so that your Lord may reduce it for you and for them."" So the Prophet (ﷺ) turned to Gabriel as if he wanted to consult him about that issue. Gabriel told him of his opinion, saying, ""Yes, if you wish."" So Gabriel ascended with him to the Irresistible and said while he was in his place, ""O Lord, please lighten our burden as my followers cannot do that."" So Allah deducted for him ten prayers where upon he returned to Moses who stopped him again and kept on sending him back to his Lord till the enjoined prayers were reduced to only five prayers. Then Moses stopped him when the prayers had been reduced to five and said, ""O Muhammad! By Allah, I tried to persuade my nation, Bani Israel to do less than this, but they could not do it and gave it up. However, your followers are weaker in body, heart, sight and hearing, so return to your Lord so that He may lighten your burden."" The Prophet (ﷺ) turned towards Gabriel for advice and Gabriel did not disapprove of that. So he ascended with him for the fifth time. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""O Lord, my followers are weak in their bodies, hearts, hearing and constitution, so lighten our burden."" On that the Irresistible said, ""O Muhammad!"" the Prophet replied, ""Labbaik and Sa`daik."" Allah said, ""The Word that comes from Me does not change, so it will be as I enjoined on you in the Mother of the Book."" Allah added, ""Every good deed will be rewarded as ten times so it is fifty (prayers) in the Mother of the Book (in reward) but you are to perform only five (in practice)."" The Prophet (ﷺ) returned to Moses who asked, ""What have you done?"" He said, ""He has lightened our burden: He has given us for every good deed a tenfold reward."" Moses said, ""By Allah! I tried to make Bani Israel observe less than that, but they gave it up. So go back to your Lord that He may lighten your burden further."" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""O Moses! By Allah, I feel shy of returning too many times to my Lord."" On that Gabriel said, ""Descend in Allah's Name."" The Prophet (ﷺ) then woke while he was in the Sacred Mosque (at Mecca). The transmitter says: When he ﷺ arose, he was in Masjid-e-Haram.","Oneness, Uniqueness of Allah (Tawheed)",Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih
7518,Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Allah will say to the people of Paradise, ""O the people of Paradise!"" They will say, 'Labbaik, O our Lord, and Sa`daik, and all the good is in Your Hands!' Allah will say, ""Are you satisfied?' They will say, 'Why shouldn't we be satisfied, O our Lord as You have given us what You have not given to any of Your created beings?' He will say, 'Shall I not give you something better than that?' They will say, 'O our Lord! What else could be better than that?' He will say, 'I bestow My Pleasure on you and will never be angry with you after that.'

7519,Narrated Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Once the Prophet (ﷺ) was preaching while a bedouin was sitting there. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""A man from among the people of Paradise will request Allah to allow him to cultivate the land Allah will say to him, 'Haven't you got whatever you desire?' He will reply, 'yes, but I like to cultivate the land (Allah will permit him and) he will sow the seeds, and within seconds the plants will grow and ripen and (the yield) will be harvested and piled in heaps like mountains. On that Allah will say (to him), ""Take, here you are, O son of Adam, for nothing satisfies you.' ""On that the bedouin said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Such man must be either from Quraish or from Ansar, for they are farmers while we are not."" On that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiled .","Oneness, Uniqueness of Allah (Tawheed)",Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih
7520,Narrated `Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہما :,"I asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ""What is the biggest sin in the sight of Allah?"" He said, ""To set up rivals unto Allah though He alone created you."" I said, ""In fact, that is a tremendous sin,"" and added, ""What next?"" He said, ""To kill your son being afraid that he may share your food with you."" I further asked, ""What next?"" He said, ""To commit illegal sexual intercourse with the wife of your neighbor.""","Oneness, Uniqueness of Allah (Tawheed)",Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih
7521,Narrated `Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Two person of Bani Thaqif and one from Quarish (or two persons from Quraish and one from Bani Thaqif) who had fat bellies but little wisdom, met near the Ka`ba. One of them said, ""Did you see that Allah hears what we say? "" The other said, ""He hears us if we speak aloud, but He does not hear if we speak in stealthy quietness (softly)."" The third fellow said, ""If He hears when we speak aloud, then He surely hears us if we speak in stealthy quietness (softly)."" So Allah revealed the Verse:-- 'And you have not been screening against yourselves, lest your ears, and your eyes and your skins should testify against you...""

7522,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"""How can you ask the people of the Scriptures about their Books while you have Allah's Book (the Qur'an) which is the most recent of the Books revealed by Allah, and you read it in its pure undistorted form?""","Oneness, Uniqueness of Allah (Tawheed)",Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih
7523,Narrated `Abdullah bin `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"""O the group of Muslims! How can you ask the people of the Scriptures about anything while your Book which Allah has revealed to your Prophet contains the most recent news from Allah and is pure and not distorted? Allah has told you that the people of the Scriptures have changed some of Allah's Books and distorted it and wrote something with their own hands and said, 'This is from Allah, so as to have a minor gain for it. Won't the knowledge that has come to you stop you from asking them? No, by Allah, we have never seen a man from them asking you about that (the Book Al-Qur'an ) which has been revealed to you.","Oneness, Uniqueness of Allah (Tawheed)",Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih
7524,Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair reported from Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما:,"(regarding the explanation of the Verse: 'Do not move your tongue concerning (the Qur'an) to make haste therewith) . He said, ""The Prophet (ﷺ) used to undergo great difficulty in receiving the Divine Inspiration and used to move his lips.' Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما said (to Sa`id), ""I move them (my lips) as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to move his lips."" And Sa`id said (to me), ""I move my lips as I saw Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما moving his lips,"" and then he moved his lips. So Allah revealed:-- '(O Muhammad!) Do not move your tongue concerning (the Qur'an) to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it and give you (O Muhammad) the ability to recite it. (i.e., to collect it in your chest and then you recite it).' (75.16-17) But when We have recited it, to you (O Muhammad through Gabriel) then follow you its recital.' (75.18) This means, ""You should listen to it and keep quiet and then it is upon Us to make you recite it."" The narrator added, ""So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to listen whenever Gabriel came to him, and when Gabriel left, the Prophet (ﷺ) would recite the Qur'an as Gabriel had recited it to him.""","Oneness, Uniqueness of Allah (Tawheed)",Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih
7525,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"regarding the explanation of the Verse:-- '(O Muhammad!) Neither say your prayer aloud, nor say it in a low tone.' (17.110) This Verse was revealed while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was hiding himself at Mecca. At that time, when he led his companions in prayer, he used to raise his voice while reciting the Qur'an; and if the pagans heard him, they would abuse the Qur'an, its Revealer, and the one who brought it. So Allah said to His Prophet: ""Neither say your prayer aloud. i.e., your recitation (of Qur'an) lest the pagans should hear (it) and abuse the Qur'an"" nor say it in a low tone, ""lest your voice should fail to reach your companions, ""but follow a way between.""

Masrooq states that Hadrat Aishah رضی اللہ عنہا said: Don't testify him who says to you that the prophet ﷺ concealed anything if the revelation, for Allah said: 'O Apostle Muhammad!

The man said, ""What is next?"" The Prophet said, ""To commit illegal sexual intercourse with the wife of your neighbor.""

Then the people of the Gospel were given the Gospel and they acted on it till `Asr Prayer and then they were unable to carry on, so they were given la reward equal to) one Qirat each. Then you were given the Qur'an and you acted on it till sunset, therefore you were given (a reward equal to) two Qirats each.
