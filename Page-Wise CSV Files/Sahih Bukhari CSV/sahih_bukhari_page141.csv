I went to the Mosque and asked about the Prophet . They said, ""He had gone in this direction."" So I followed his way, asking about him till he entered a place called Bir Aris. I sat at its gate that was made of date-palm leaves till the Prophet (ﷺ) finished answering the call of nature and performed ablution. Then I went up to him to see him sitting at the well of Aris at the middle of its edge with his legs uncovered, hanging in the well. I greeted him and went back and sat at the gate. I said, ""Today I will be the gatekeeper of the Prophet."" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ came and pushed the gate. I asked, ""Who is it?"" He said, ""Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ ."" I told him to wait, went in and said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ asks for permission to enter."" He said, ""Admit him and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise."" So I went out and said to Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ , ""Come in, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise"" Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ entered and sat on the right side of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on the built edge of the well and hung his legs n the well as the Prophet (ﷺ) did and uncovered his legs. I then returned and sat (at the gate). I had left my brother performing ablution and he intended to follow me. So I said (to myself). ""If Allah wants good for so-and-so (i.e. my brother) He will bring him here."" Suddenly somebody moved the door. I asked, ""Who is it?"" He said, ""`Umar bin Al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ ."" I asked him to wait, went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), greeted him and said, `Umar bin Al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ asks the permission to enter."" He said, ""Admit him, and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise."" I went to ""`Umar رضی اللہ عنہ and said ""Come in, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise.""

I returned and sat (at the gate) and said, (to myself), ""If Allah wants good for so-and-so, He will bring him here."" Somebody came and moved the door. I asked ""Who is it?"" He replied, ""Uthman bin `Affan."" I asked him to wait and went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and informed him. He said, ""Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise, I asked him to wait and went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and informed him. He said, ""Adult him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall him."" So I went up to him and said to him, ""Come in; Allah's Apostle gives you the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall you. ""Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ then came in and found that the built edge of the well was occupied, so he sat opposite to the Prophet (ﷺ) on the other side.

I want to ask you about something; please tell me about it. Do you know that `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ fled away on the day (of the battle) of Uhud?"" Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما said, ""Yes."" The (Egyptian) man said, ""Do you know that `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ was absent on the day (of the battle) of Badr and did not join it?"" Ibn `Umar said, ""Yes."" The man said, ""Do you know that he failed to attend the Ar Ridwan pledge and did not witness it (i.e. Hudaibiya pledge of allegiance)?"" Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما said, ""Yes."" The man said, ""Allahu Akbar!"" Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما said, ""Let me explain to you (all these three things). As for his flight on the day of Uhud, I testify that Allah has excused him and forgiven him; and as for his absence from the battle of Badr, it was due to the fact that the daughter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was his wife and she was sick then. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him, ""You will receive the same reward and share (of the booty) as anyone of those who participated in the battle of Badr (if you stay with her).' As for his absence from the Ar-Ridwan pledge of allegiance, had there been any person in Mecca more respectable than `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ (to be sent as a representative). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) would have sent him instead of him. No doubt, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had sent him, and the incident of the Ar-Ridwan pledge of Allegiance happened after `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ had gone to Mecca. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) held out his right hand saying, 'This is `Uthman's hand.' He stroke his (other) hand with it saying, 'This (pledge of allegiance) is on the behalf of `Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ .' Then Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما said to the man, 'Bear (these) excuses in mind with you.'",Companions of the Prophet,Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
