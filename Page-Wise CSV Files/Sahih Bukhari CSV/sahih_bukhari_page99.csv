By chance I looked up and saw it. So, I turned to the horse, saddled it and rode on it, forgetting to take the spear and the whip. I asked them if they could hand over to me the whip and the spear but they said, 'No, by Allah, we shall not help you in that in any way.' I became angry and got down from the horse, picked up both the things and rode the horse again. I attacked the onager and slaughtered it, and brought it (after it had been dead). They took it (cooked some of it) and started eating it, but they doubted whether it was allowed for them to eat it or not, as they were in the state of Ihram. So, we proceeded and I hid with me one of its fore-legs. When we met Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and asked him about the case, he asked, 'Do you have a portion of it with you?' I replied in the affirmative and gave him that fleshy foreleg which he ate completely while he was in the state of Ihram .

One group consisted of `Aisha, Hafsa, Safiyya and Sauda; and the other group consisted of Um Salama and the other wives of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). The Muslims knew that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) loved `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا , so if any of them had a gift and wished to give to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), he would delay it, till Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had come to `Aisha's home and then he would send his gift to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in her home. The group of Um Salama رضی اللہ عنہا discussed the matter together and decided that Um Salama رضی اللہ عنہا should request Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to tell the people to send their gifts to him in whatever wife's house he was. Um Salama رضی اللہ عنہا told Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) of what they had said, but he did not reply. Then they (those wives) asked Um Salama about it. She said, ""He did not say anything to me."" They asked her to talk to him again. She talked to him again when she met him on her day, but he gave no reply. When they asked her, she replied that he had given no reply. They said to her, ""Talk to him till he gives you a reply."" When it was her turn, she talked to him again. He then said to her, ""Do not hurt me regarding Aisha, as the Divine Inspirations do not come to me on any of the beds except that of Aisha."" On that Um Salama said, ""I repent to Allah for hurting you."" Then the group of Um Salama called Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and sent her to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to say to him, ""Your wives request to treat them and the daughter of Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ on equal terms."" Then Fatima conveyed the message to him. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""O my daughter! Don't you love whom I love?"" She replied in the affirmative and returned and told them of the situation. They requested her to go to him again but she refused. They then sent Zainab bint Jahsh رضی اللہ عنہا who went to him and used harsh words saying, ""Your wives request you to treat them and the daughter of Ibn Abu Quhafa on equal terms."" On that she raised her voice and abused `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا to her face so much so that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) looked at `Aisha to see whether she would retort. `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا started replying to Zainab رضی اللہ عنہا till she silenced her. The Prophet (ﷺ) then looked at `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا and said, ""She is really the daughter of Abu Bakr."" Imam Bukhari says: The last point is mentioned in Hadrat Fatima's episode.
