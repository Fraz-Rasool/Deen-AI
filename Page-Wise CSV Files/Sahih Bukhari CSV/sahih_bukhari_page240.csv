Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) thought that those people had left by then, so he returned, and I too, returned with him till he entered upon Zainab ر ضی اللہ عنہا and found that they were still sitting there and had not yet gone. The Prophet (ﷺ) went out again, and so did I with him till he reached the lintel of `Aisha's dwelling place, and then he thought that those people must have left by then, so he returned, and so did I with him, and found those people had gone.
