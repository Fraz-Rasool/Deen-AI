The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'O Abu Musa (O `Abdullah bin Qais!).' I said, 'By Him Who sent you with the Truth, these two men did not tell me what was in their hearts and I did not feel (realize) that they were seeking employment.' As if I were looking now at his Siwak being drawn to a corner under his lips, and he said, 'We never (or, we do not) appoint for our affairs anyone who seeks to be employed. But O Abu Musa! (or `Abdullah bin Qais!) Go to Yemen.'"" The Prophet then sent Mu`adh bin Jabal رضی اللہ عنہ after him and when Mu`adh reached him, he spread out a cushion for him and requested him to get down (and sit on the cushion). Behold: There was a fettered man beside Abu Muisa. Mu`adh asked, ""Who is this (man)?"" Abu Muisa said, ""He was a Jew and became a Muslim and then reverted back to Judaism."" Then Abu Muisa requested Mu`adh رضی اللہ عنہ to sit down but Mu`adh رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I will not sit down till he has been killed. This is the judgment of Allah and His Apostle (for such cases) and repeated it thrice. Then Abu Musa رضی اللہ عنہ ordered that the man be killed, and he was killed.

"" ""Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""By Allah! I will fight whoever differentiates between prayers and Zakat as Zakat is the right to be taken from property (according to Allah's Orders). By Allah! If they refused to pay me even a kid they used to pay to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), I would fight with them for withholding it."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""By Allah: It was nothing, but I noticed that Allah opened Abu Bakr's chest towards the decision to fight, therefore I realized that his decision was right.""",Apostates,Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih
6926,Narrated Anas bin Malik رضی اللہ عنہ :,"A Jew passed by Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, ""As-Samu 'Alaika."" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said in reply, ""We 'Alaika.""

6930,Narrated `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Whenever I tell you a narration from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), by Allah, I would rather fall down from the sky than ascribe a false statement to him, but if I tell you something between me and you (not a Hadith) then it was indeed a trick (i.e., I may say things just to cheat my enemy). No doubt I heard Allah's Apostle saying, ""During the last days there will appear some young foolish people who will say the best words but their faith will not go beyond their throats (i.e. they will have no faith) and will go out from (leave) their religion as an arrow goes out of the game.

6932,Narrated Al-Harauriyya:,"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""They will go out of Islam as an arrow darts out of the game's body.'",Apostates,Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih
6933,Narrated Abu Sa`id رضی اللہ عنہ :,"While the Prophet (ﷺ) was distributing (something, `Abdullah bin Dhil Khawaisira at-Tamimi came and said, ""Be just, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!"" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Woe to you ! Who would be just if I were not?"" `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, ""Allow me to cut off his neck ! "" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "" Leave him, for he has companions, and if you compare your prayers with their prayers and your fasting with theirs, you will look down upon your prayers and fasting, in comparison to theirs. Yet they will go out of the religion as an arrow darts through the game's body in which case, if the Qudhadh of the arrow is examined, nothing will be found on it, and when its Nasl is examined, nothing will be found on it; and then its Nadiyi is examined, nothing will be found on it. The arrow has been too fast to be smeared by dung and blood. The sign by which these people will be recognized will be a man whose one hand (or breast) will be like the breast of a woman (or like a moving piece of flesh). These people will appear when there will be differences among the people (Muslims)."" Abu Sa`id added: I testify that I heard this from the Prophet (ﷺ) and also testify that `Ali killed those people while I was with him. The man with the description given by the Prophet (ﷺ) was brought to `Ali. The following Verses were revealed in connection with that very person (i.e., `Abdullah bin Dhil-Khawaisira at-Tarnimi): 'And among them are men who accuse you (O Muhammad) in the matter of (the distribution of) the alms.' (9.58)",Apostates,Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih
6934,Narrated Yusair bin `Amr:,"I asked Sahl bin Hunaif رضی اللہ عنہ , ""Did you hear the Prophet (ﷺ) saying anything about Al-Khawarij?""

""There will appear in it (i.e, Iraq) some people who will recite the Qur'an but it will not go beyond their throats, and they will go out from (leave) Islam as an arrow darts through the game's body.' """,Apostates,Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih

6936,Narrated Umar bin Al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ :,"I heard Hisham bin Al-Hakim reciting Surat Al-Furqan during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). I listened to his recitation and noticed that he recited it in several different ways which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had not taught me. So I was about to jump over him during his Salat (prayer) but I waited till he finished his Salat (prayer) whereupon I put, either his upper garment or my upper garment around his neck and seized him by it and asked him, ""Who has taught you this Surah?"" He replied: ""Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has taught it to me."" I said (to him), ""You have told a lie! By Allah, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has taught me this Surah which I have heard you reciting."" So I dragged him to the Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). I said: ""O Allah's Messenger I have heard this man reciting Surat Al-Furqan in a way in which you have not taught me, and you did teach me Surah Al-Furqan."" On that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""O 'Umar, release him! Recite, O Hisham"". So Hisham recited before him in the way as I heard him reciting. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""It has been revealed like this."" Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""Recite, O 'Umar"" So recited it. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""It has been revealed like this."" And then he added, ""This Qur'an has been revealed to be recited in seven different ways, so recite it whichever way is easier for you.""",Apostates,Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih
6937,Narrated `Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہ :,"When the Verse:--'Those who believe and did not confuse their belief with wrong (worshipping others besides Allah).' (6.82) was revealed, it was hard on the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) and they said, ""Who among us has not wronged (oppressed) himself?"" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""The meaning of the Verse is not as you think, but it is as Luqman said to his son, 'O my son! Join not in worship others with Allah, Verily! Joining others in worship with Allah is a great wrong indeed.'"" (31.13)",Apostates,Sahih Bukhari,9,Sahih
