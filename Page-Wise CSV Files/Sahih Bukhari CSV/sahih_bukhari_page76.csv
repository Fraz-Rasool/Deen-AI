The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Fast like the fasting of the Prophet (ﷺ) David and do not fast more than that."" I said, ""How was the fasting of the Prophet (ﷺ) of Allah, David?"" He said, ""Half of the year,"" (i.e. he used to fast on every alternate day).

I said so."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""You can not do that. So, fast for few days and give it up for few days, offer Salat (prayer) and sleep. Fast three days a month as the reward of good deeds is multiplied ten times and that will be equal to one year of fasting."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me, ""Fast one day and give up fasting for two days."" I replied, ""I can do better than that."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me, ""Fast one day and give up fasting for a day and that is the fasting of Prophet David and that is the best fasting.""

Fast (for some days) and give up fasting (for some days); pray and sleep, for your eyes have a right on you, and your body and your family (i.e. wife) have a right on you."" I replied, ""I have more power than that (fasting)."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Then fast like the fasts of (the Prophet) David"". I said, ""How?"" He replied, ""He used to fast on alternate days, and he used not to flee on meeting the enemy."" I said, ""From where can I get that chance?""

1979,Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As رضی اللہ عنہما :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me, ""You fast daily all the year and pray every night all the night?"" I replied in the affirmative.

The fasting of three days (a month) will be equal to the fasting of the whole year."" I replied, ""I have the power for more than this.""

I replied, ""O Allah's Apostle! (I can fast more)."" He said, ""Five?"" I replied, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! (I can fast more)."" He said, ""Seven?"" I replied, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! (I can fast more)."" He said, ""Nine (days per month)?"" I replied, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! (I can fast more)"" He said, ""Eleven (days per month)?""
