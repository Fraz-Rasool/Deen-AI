52,Narrated An-Nu'man bin Bashir:,"I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, 'Both legal and illegal things are evident but in between them there are doubtful (suspicious) things and most of the people have no knowledge about them.

Beware! Every king has a Hima and the Hima of Allah on the earth is His illegal (forbidden) things. Beware!
