4251,Narrated Al-Bara رضی اللہ عنہ :,"When the Prophet (ﷺ) went out for the `Umra in the month of Dhal-Qa'da, the people of Mecca did not allow him to enter Mecca till he agreed to conclude a peace treaty with them by virtue of which he would stay in Mecca for three days only (in the following year). When the agreement was being written, the Muslims wrote: ""This is the peace treaty, which Muhammad, Apostle of Allah has concluded."" The infidels said (to the Prophet), ""We do not agree with you on this, for if we knew that you are Apostle of Allah we would not have prevented you for anything (i.e. entering Mecca, etc.), but you are Muhammad, the son of `Abdullah."" Then he said to `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ , ""Erase (the name of) 'Apostle of Allah'."" `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""No, by Allah, I will never erase you (i.e. your name)."" Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) took the writing sheet...and he did not know a better writing.. and he wrote or got it the following written! ""This is the peace treaty which Muhammad, the son of `Abdullah, has concluded: ""Muhammad should not bring arms into Mecca except sheathed swords, and should not take with him any person of the people of Mecca even if such a person wanted to follow him, and if any of his companions wants to stay in Mecca, he should not forbid him."" (In the next year) when the Prophet (ﷺ) entered Mecca and the allowed period of stay elapsed, the infidels came to `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ and said ""Tell your companion (Muhammad) to go out, as the allowed period of his stay has finished."" So the Prophet (ﷺ) departed (from Mecca) and the daughter of Hamza followed him shouting ""O Uncle, O Uncle!"" `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ took her by the hand and said to Fatima رضی اللہ عنہا , ""Take the daughter of your uncle."" So she made her ride (on her horse). (When they reached Medina) `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ , Zaid رضی اللہ عنہ and Ja`far رضی اللہ عنہ quarreled about her. `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I took her for she is the daughter of my uncle."" Ja`far رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""She is the daughter of my uncle and her aunt is my wife."" Zaid رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""She is the daughter of my brother."" On that, the Prophet (ﷺ) gave her to her aunt and said, ""The aunt is of the same status as the mother."" He then said to `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ , ""You are from me, and I am from you,"" and said to Ja`far رضی اللہ عنہ , ""You resemble me in appearance and character,"" and said to Zaid رضی اللہ عنہ , ""You are our brother and our freed slave."" `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ said to the Prophet 'Won't you marry the daughter of Hamza رضی اللہ عنہ ?""

4252,Narrated Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) set out with the intention of performing `Umra, but the infidels of Quraish intervened between him and the Ka`ba, so the Prophet (ﷺ) slaughtered his Hadi (i.e. sacrificing animals and shaved his head at Al-Hudaibiya and concluded a peace treaty with them (i.e. the infidels) on condition that he would perform the `Umra the next year and that he would not carry arms against them except swords, and would not stay (in Mecca) more than what they would allow.

Don't you hear what Abu `Abdur-Rahman is saying? He is saying that the Prophet performed four `Umra, one of which was in Rajab."" `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا said, ""The Prophet (ﷺ) did not perform any `Umra but he (i.e. Ibn `Umar رضی اللہ عنہما) witnessed it.

The only cause which prevented the Prophet (ﷺ) from ordering them to do Ramal in all the rounds of Tawaf, was that he pitied them. The other report of Hadrat Ibn-e-Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما adds: When the prophet (ﷺ) got in during the year of peace Accord, he ﷺ commanded the Muslims to move strutingly with quick steps, so that the polytheists should observe their might and then the people were standing in front of mount Qoaiqiaan.",Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (PBUH) (Al-Maghaazi),Sahih Bukhari,5,Sahih
