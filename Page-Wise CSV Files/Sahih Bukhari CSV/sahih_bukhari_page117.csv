3039,Narrated Al-Bara bin Azib رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) appointed `Abdullah bin Jubair رضی اللہ عنہ as the commander of the infantry men (archers) who were fifty on the day (of the battle) of Uhud. He instructed them, ""Stick to your place, and don't leave it even if you see birds snatching us, till I send for you; and if you see that we have defeated the infidels and made them flee, even then you should not leave your place till I send for you."" Then the infidels were defeated. By Allah, I saw the women fleeing lifting up their clothes revealing their leg-bangles and their legs. So, the companions of `Abdullah bin Jubair رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""The booty! O people, the booty ! Your companions have become victorious, what are you waiting for now?"" `Abdullah bin Jubair رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""Have you forgotten what Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to you?"" They replied, ""By Allah! We will go to the people (i.e. the enemy) and collect our share from the war booty."" But when they went to them, they were forced to turn back defeated. At that time Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in their rear was calling them back. Only twelve men remained with the Prophet (ﷺ) and the infidels martyred seventy men from us. On the day (of the battle) of Badr, the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions had caused the 'Pagans to lose 140 men, seventy of whom were captured and seventy were killed. Then Abu Sufyan asked thrice, ""Is Muhammad present amongst these people?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered his companions not to answer him. Then he asked thrice, ""Is the son of Abu Quhafa present amongst these people?"" He asked again thrice, ""Is the son of Al-Khattab present amongst these people?"" He then returned to his companions and said, ""As for these (men), they have been killed."" `Umar رضی اللہ عنہ could not control himself and said (to Abu Sufyan), ""You told a lie, by Allah! O enemy of Allah! All those you have mentioned are alive, and the thing which will make you unhappy is still there."" Abu Sufyan said, ""Our victory today is a counterbalance to yours in the battle of Badr, and in war (the victory) is always undecided and is shared in turns by the belligerents, and you will find some of your (killed) men mutilated, but I did not urge my men to do so, yet I do not feel sorry for their deed"" After that he started reciting cheerfully, ""O Hubal, be high! (1) On that the Prophet (ﷺ) said (to his companions), ""Why don't you answer him back?"" They said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) What shall we say?"" He said, ""Say, Allah is Higher and more Sublime."" (Then) Abu Sufyan said, ""We have the (idol) Al `Uzza, and you have no `Uzza."" The Prophet said (to his companions), ""Why don't you answer him back?"" They asked, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What shall we say?"" He said, ""Says Allah is our Helper and you have no helper.""",Fighting for the Cause of Allah (Jihaad),Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih
3040,Narrated Anas رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was the (most handsome), most generous and the bravest of all the people. Once the people of Medina got frightened having heard an uproar at night. So, the Prophet (ﷺ) met the people while he was riding an unsaddled horse belonging to Abu Talha رضی اللہ عنہ and carrying his sword (slung over his shoulder). He said (to them), ""Don't get scared, don't get scared."" Then he added, ""I found it (i.e the horse) very fast.""",Fighting for the Cause of Allah (Jihaad),Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih
3041,Narrated Salama رضی اللہ عنہ :,"I went out of Medina towards Al-Ghaba. When I reached the mountain path of Al-Ghaba, a slave of `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf رضی اللہ عنہ met me. I said to him, ""Woe to you! What brought you here?"" He replied, ""The she-camels of the Prophet (ﷺ) have been taken away."" I said, ""Who took them?"" He said, ""Ghatafan and Fazara."" So, I sent three cries, ""O Sabaha-h ! O Sabahah !"" so loudly that made the people in between its (i.e. Medina's) two mountains hear me. Then I rushed till I met them after they had taken the camels away. I started throwing arrows at them saying, ""I am the son of Al-Akwa`""; and today perish the mean people!"" So, I saved the she-camels from them before they (i.e. the robbers) could drink water. When I returned driving the camels, the Prophet (ﷺ) met me, I said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) Those people are thirsty and I have prevented them from drinking water, so send some people to chase them."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""O son of Al-Akwa`, you have gained power (over your enemy), so forgive (them). (Besides) those people are now being entertained by their folk.""",Fighting for the Cause of Allah (Jihaad),Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih
3042,Narrated Abu 'Is-haq:,"A man asked Al-Bara رضی اللہ عنہ ""O Abu '`Umara! Did you flee on the day (of the battle) of Hunain?"" Al-Bara رضی اللہ عنہ replied while I was listening, ""As for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) he did not flee on that day. Abu Sufyan bin Al- Harith was holding the reins of his mule and when the pagans attacked him, he dismounted and started saying, 'I am the Prophet, and there is no lie about it; I am the son of `Abdul Muttalib.' On that day nobody was seen braver than the Prophet.",Fighting for the Cause of Allah (Jihaad),Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih
3043,Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri رضی اللہ عنہ :,"When the tribe of Bani Quraiza was ready to accept Sa`d's judgment, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent for Sa`d رضی اللہ عنہ who was near to him. Sa`d رضی اللہ عنہ came, riding a donkey and when he came near, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said (to the Ansar), ""Stand up for your leader."" Then Sa`d رضی اللہ عنہ came and sat beside Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who said to him. ""These people are ready to accept your judgment."" Sa`d رضی اللہ عنہ said, ""I give the judgment that their warriors should be killed and their children and women should be taken as prisoners."" The Prophet (ﷺ) then remarked, ""O Sa`d! You have judged amongst them with (or similar to) the judgment of the King Allah.""",Fighting for the Cause of Allah (Jihaad),Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih
3044,Narrated Anas bin Malik (رضی اللہ عنہ):,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) entered (Makkah) in the year of the Conquest (of Makkah) wearing a helmet over his head. After he took it off, a man came and said, ""Ibn Khatal is clinging to the curtains of the Ka'bah."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Kill him.""",Fighting for the Cause of Allah (Jihaad),Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih
3045,Narrated Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent a Sariya of ten men as spies under the leadership of `Asim bin Thabit al-Ansari رضی اللہ عنہ , the grandfather of `Asim bin `Umar Al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ . They proceeded till they reached Hadaa, a place between 'Usfan, and Mecca, and their news reached a branch of the tribe of Hudhail called Bani Lihyan. About two-hundred men, who were all archers, hurried to follow their tracks till they found the place where they had eaten dates they had brought with them from Medina. They said, ""These are the dates of Yathrib (i.e. Medina), ""and continued following their tracks When `Asim رضی اللہ عنہ and his companions saw their pursuers, they went up a high place and the infidels circled them. The infidels said to them, ""Come down and surrender, and we promise and guarantee you that we will not kill any one of you"" `Asim bin Thabit رضی اللہ عنہ ; the leader of the Sariya said, ""By Allah! I will not come down to be under the protection of infidels. O Allah! Convey our news to Your Prophet. Then the infidels threw arrows at them till they martyred `Asim رضی اللہ عنہ along with six other men, and three men came down accepting their promise and convention, and they were Khubaib-al-Ansari and Ibn Dathina and another man So, when the infidels captured them, they undid the strings of their bows and tied them. Then the third (of the captives) said, ""This is the first betrayal. By Allah! I will not go with you. No doubt these, namely the martyred, have set a good example to us."" So, they dragged him and tried to compel him to accompany them, but as he refused, they killed him. They took Khubaid and Ibn Dathina with them and sold them (as slaves) in Mecca (and all that took place) after the battle of Badr. Khubaib was bought by the sons of Al-Harith bin 'Amir bin Naufal bin `Abd Manaf. It was Khubaib who had killed Al-Harith bin 'Amir on the day (of the battle of) Badr. So, Khubaib remained a prisoner with those people. Narrated Az-Zuhri: 'Ubaidullah bin 'Iyyad said that the daughter of Al-Harith had told him, ""When those people gathered (to kill Khubaib) he borrowed a razor from me to shave his pubes and I gave it to him. Then he took a son of mine while I was unaware when he came upon him. I saw him placing my son on his thigh and the razor was in his hand. I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed the agitation on my face and said, 'Are you afraid that I will kill him? No, I will never do so.' By Allah, I never saw a prisoner better than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating of a bunch of grapes in his hand while he was chained in irons, and there was no fruit at that time in Mecca."" The daughter of Al-Harith used to say, ""It was a boon Allah bestowed upon Khubaib."" When they took him out of the Sanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him outside its boundaries, Khubaib requested them to let him offer two rak`at (prayer). They allowed him and he offered Two rak`at and then said, ""Hadn't I been afraid that you would think that I was afraid (of being killed), I would have prolonged the prayer. O Allah, kill them all with no exception."" (He then recited the poetic verse):-- ""I being martyred as a Muslim, Do not mind how I am killed in Allah's Cause, For my killing is for Allah's Sake, And if Allah wishes, He will bless the amputated parts of a torn body"" Then the son of Al Harith killed him. So, it was Khubaib who set the tradition for any Muslim sentenced to death in captivity, to offer a two-rak`at prayer (before being killed). Allah fulfilled the invocation of `Asim bin Thabit رضی اللہ عنہ on that very day on which he was martyred. The Prophet (ﷺ) informed his companions of their news and what had happened to them. Later on when some infidels from Quraish were informed that `Asim رضی اللہ عنہ had been killed, they sent some people to fetch a part of his body (i.e. his head) by which he would be recognized. (That was because) `Asim رضی اللہ عنہ had killed one of their chiefs on the day (of the battle) of Badr. So, a swarm of wasps, resembling a shady cloud, were sent to hover over `Asim رضی اللہ عنہ and protect him from their messenger and thus they could not cut off anything from his flesh.",Fighting for the Cause of Allah (Jihaad),Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih

I don't think we have such knowledge, but we have the ability of understanding which Allah may endow a person with, so that he may understand the Qur'an, and we have what is written in this paper as well."" I asked, ""What is written in this paper?""

The people (present there) differed in this matter and people should not differ before a prophet. They said, ""Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is seriously sick.' The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Let me alone, as the state in which I am now, is better than what you are calling me for."" The Prophet (ﷺ) on his death-bed, gave three orders saying, ""Expel the pagans from the Arabian Peninsula, respect and give gifts to the foreign delegates as you have seen me dealing with them.""

3059,Narrated Aslam:,"`Umar bin Al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ appointed a freed slave of his, called Hunai, manager of the Hima (i.e. a pasture devoted for grazing the animals of the Zakat or other specified animals). He said to him, ""O Hunai! Don't oppress the Muslims and ward off their curse (invocations against you) for the invocation of the oppressed is responded to (by Allah); and allow the shepherd having a few camels and those having a few sheep (to graze their animals), and take care not to allow the livestock of `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf and the livestock of (`Uthman) bin `Affan, for if their livestock should perish, then they have their farms and gardens, while those who own a few camels and those who own a few sheep, if their livestock should perish, would bring their dependents to me and appeal for help saying, 'O chief of the believers! O chief of the believers!' Would I then neglect them? (No, of course). So, I find it easier to let them have water and grass rather than to give them gold and silver (from the Muslims' treasury). By Allah, these people think that I have been unjust to them. This is their land, and during the prelslamic period, they fought for it and they embraced Islam (willingly) while it was in their possession. By Him in Whose Hand my life is!
