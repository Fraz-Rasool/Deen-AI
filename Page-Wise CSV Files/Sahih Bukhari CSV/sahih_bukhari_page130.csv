She replied, 'For he has spread the (slanderous) story.' `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا said, 'What story?' The woman then told her the story. `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا asked, 'Have Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) heard about it ?' She said, 'Yes.' `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہا fell down senseless (on hearing that), and when she came to her senses, she got fever and shaking of the body. The Prophet (ﷺ) came and asked, 'What is wrong with her?' I said, 'She has got fever because of a story which has been rumored.' `Aisha رضی اللہ عنہ got up and said, 'By Allah! Even if I took an oath, you would not believe me, and if I put forward an excuse, You would not excuse me. My example and your example is just like that example of Jacob and his sons. Against that which you assert, it is Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.'

(Impossible) The Apostles did not suspect their Lord of such a thing. But this Verse is concerned with the Apostles' followers who had faith in their Lord and believed in their apostles and their period of trials was long and Allah's Help was delayed till the apostles gave up hope for the conversion of the disbelievers amongst their nation and suspected that even their followers were shaken in their belief, Allah's Help then came to them."" Imam Abdullah Bukhari says: ""اسْتَيْأَسُوا‏"" , ""يَئِسْتُ‏"" is from the head ""‏ افْتَعَلُو"" .

When he told him, Waraqa said, ""That is the same angel whom Allah sent to the Prophet) Moses. Should I live till you receive the Divine Message, I will support you strongly.

3400,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"He differed with Al-Hur bin Qais Al-Fazari رضی اللہ عنہ regarding the companion of Moses. Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما said that he was Al-Khadir. Meanwhile Ubai bin Ka`b رضی اللہ عنہ passed by them and Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما called him saying, ""My friend and I have differed regarding Moses' companion whom Moses asked the way to meet. Have you heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) mentioning something about him?"" He said, ""Yes, I heard Allah's Apostle saying, 'While Moses was sitting in the company of some Israelites, a man came and asked (him), 'Do you know anyone who is more learned than you?' Moses replied, 'No.' So, Allah sent the Divine Inspiration to Moses: 'Yes, Our slave, Khadir (is more learned than you).' Moses asked how to meet him (i.e. Khadir). So, the fish, was made, as a sign for him, and he was told that when the fish was lost, he should return and there he would meet him. So, Moses went on looking for the sign of the fish in the sea. The servant boy of Moses said to him, 'Do you know that when we were sitting by the side of the rock, I forgot the fish, and t was only Satan who made me forget to tell (you) about it.' Moses said, That was what we were seeking after,' and both of them returned, following their footmarks and found Khadir; and what happened further to them, is mentioned in Allah's Book.""",Prophets,Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih
3401,Narrated Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما :,"""Nauf Al-Bukah claims that Moses, the companion of Al-Khadir was not Moses (the prophet) of the children of Israel, but some other Moses."" Ibn `Abbas Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما said, ""Allah's enemy (i.e. Nauf) has told a lie. Ubai bin Ka`b رضی اللہ عنہ told us that the Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'Once Moses stood up and addressed Bani Israel. He was asked who was the most learned man amongst the people. He said, 'I.' Allah admonished him as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So, Allah said to him, 'Yes, at the junction of the two seas there is a Slave of Mine who is more learned than you.' Moses said, 'O my Lord! How can I meet him?' Allah said, 'Take a fish and put it in a large basket and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish.' Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and proceeded along with his (servant) boy, Yusha` bin Noon, till they reached the rock where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down). Moses slept, and the fish, moving out of the basket, fell into the sea. It took its way into the sea (straight) as in a tunnel. Allah stopped the flow of water over the fish and it became like an arch (the Prophet (ﷺ) pointed out this arch with his hands). They travelled the rest of the night, and the next day Moses said to his boy (servant), 'Give us our food, for indeed, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours.' Moses did not feel tired till he crossed that place which Allah had ordered him to seek after. His boy (servant) said to him, 'Do you know that when we were sitting near that rock, I forgot the fish, and none but Satan caused me to forget to tell (you) about it, and it took its course into the sea in an amazing way?.' So there was a path for the fish and that astonished them. Moses said, 'That was what we were seeking after.' So, both of them retraced their footsteps till they reached the rock. There they saw a man Lying covered with a garment. Moses greeted him and he replied saying, 'How do people greet each other in your land?' Moses said, 'I am Moses.' The man asked, 'Moses of Bani Israel?' Moses said, 'Yes, I have come to you so that you may teach me from those things which Allah has taught you.' He said, 'O Moses! I have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught me, and which you do not know, while you have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught you and which I do not know.' Moses asked, 'May I follow you?' He said, 'But you will not be able to remain patient with me for how can you be patient about things which you will not be able to understand?' (Moses said, 'You will find me, if Allah so will, truly patient, and I will not disobey you in aught.') So, both of them set out walking along the sea-shore, a boat passed by them and they asked the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and so they took them on board without fare. When they were on board the boat, a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or twice into the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, 'O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Allah's Knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea with its beak.' Then suddenly Al-Khadir took an adze and plucked a plank, and Moses did not notice it till he had plucked a plank with the adze. Moses said to him, 'What have you done? They took us on board charging us nothing; yet you I have intentionally made a hole in their boat so as to drown its passengers. Verily, you have done a dreadful thing.' Al-Khadir replied, 'Did I not tell you that you would not be able to remain patient with me?' Moses replied, 'Do not blame me for what I have forgotten, and do not be hard upon me for my fault.' So the first excuse of Moses was that he had forgotten. When they had left the sea, they passed by a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of the boys head and plucked it with his hand like this. (Sufyan, the sub narrator pointed with his fingertips as if he was plucking some fruit.) Moses said to him, ""Have you killed an innocent person who has not killed any person? You have really done a horrible thing."" Al-Khadir said, ""Did I not tell you that you could not remain patient with me?' Moses said ""If I ask you about anything after this, don't accompany me. You have received an excuse from me.' Then both of them went on till they came to some people of a village, and they asked its inhabitant for wood but they refused to entertain them as guests. Then they saw therein a wall which was just going to collapse (and Al Khadir repaired it just by touching it with his hands). (Sufyan, the sub-narrator, pointed with his hands, illustrating how Al-Khadir passed his hands over the wall upwards.) Moses said, ""These are the people whom we have called on, but they neither gave us food, nor entertained us as guests, yet you have repaired their wall. If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it."" Al-Khadir said, ""This is the parting between you and me, and I shall tell you the explanation of those things on which you could not remain patient."" The Prophet (ﷺ) added, ""We wished that Moses could have remained patient by virtue of which Allah might have told us more about their story. (Sufyan the sub-narrator said that the Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""May Allah bestow His Mercy on Moses! If he had remained patient, we would have been told further about their case."") And Hadrat Ibn-e-Abbaas رضی اللہ عنہما recited the verse in this way: And before them, there was a king who used to seize every perfect boat forcibly. And the Young man (killed by Hadrat Khadir) was an Infidel and his parents were Muslims. Sufyan said to me: I have heard this Hadith twice from Amr bin Dinaar and memorized it. Sufyan was asked: Have you memorized this Hadith before hearing it from anybody (else Amr)? Have anybody reported it from Amr else me! I have memorized this Hadith after hearing it from him twice or thrice.",Prophets,Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih
3402,Narrated Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Al-Khadir علیہ السلام was named so because he sat over a barren white land, it turned green with plantation after (his sitting over it.""",Prophets,Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih
3403,Narrated Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ :,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""It was said to Bani Israel, Enter the gate (of the town) with humility (prostrating yourselves) and saying: ""Repentance"", but they changed the word and entered the town crawling on their buttocks and saying: ""A wheat grain in the hair.""",Prophets,Sahih Bukhari,4,Sahih
