2950,Ja'far b Muhammad reported on the authority of his father:,"We went to Jabir bin Abdullah رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ and he began inquiring about the people (who had gone to see him) till it was my turn. I said: I am Muhammad bin 'Ali bin Husain. He placed his hand upon my head and opened my upper button and then the lower one and then placed his palm on my chest (in order to bless me), and I was, during those days, a young boy, and he said: You are welcome, my nephew. Ask whatever you want to ask. And I asked him but as he was blind (he could not respond to me immediately), and the time for prayer came. He stood up covering himself in his mantle. And whenever he placed its ends upon his shoulders they slipped down on account of being short (in size). Another mantle was, however, lying on the clothes rack near by. And he led us in the prayer. I said to him: Tell me about the Hajj of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). And he pointed with his hand nine, and then stated: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stayed in (Medina) for nine years but did not perform Hajj, then he made a public announcement in the tenth year to the effect that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was about to perform the Hajj. A large number of persons came to Medina and all of them were anxious to follow the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and do according to his doing. We set out with him till we reached Dhu'l-Hulaifa. Asma' daughter of Umais رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا gave birth to Muhammad bin Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ . She sent message to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asking him: What should 1 do? He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) said: Take a bath, bandage your private parts and put on Ihram. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then prayed in the mosque and then mounted al-Qaswa (his she-camel) and it stood erect with him on its back at al-Baida'. And I saw as far as I could see in front of me but riders and pedestrians, and also on my right and on my left and behind me like this. And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was prominent among us and the (revelation) of the Holy Qur'an was descending upon him. And it is he who knows (its true) significance. And whatever he did, we also did that. He pronounced the Oneness of Allah (saying):"" Labbaik, O Allah, Labbaik, Labbaik. Thou hast no partner, praise and grace is Thine and the Sovereignty too; Thou hast no partner."" And the people also pronounced this Talbiya which they pronounce (today). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not reject anything out of it. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) adhered to his own Talbiya. Jabir ( رضی اللہ عنہ) said: We did not have any other intention but that of Hajj only, being unaware of the Umra (at that season), but when we came with him to the House, he touched the pillar and (made seven circuits) running three of them and walking four. And then going to the Station of Ibrahim, he recited:"" And adopt the Station of Ibrahim as a place of prayer."" And this Station was between him and the House. My father said (and I do not know whether he had made a mention of it but that was from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) that he recited in two rak'ahs:"" say: He is Allah One,"" and say:"" Say: O unbelievers."" He then returned to the pillar (Hajar Aswad) and kissed it. He then went out of the gate to al-Safa' and as he reached near it he recited:"" Al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the signs appointed by Allah,"" (adding: ) I begin with what Allah (has commanded me) to begin. He first mounted al-Safa' till he saw the House, and facing Qibla he declared the Oneness of Allah and glorified Him, and said:"" There is no god but Allah, One, there is no partner with Him. His is the Sovereignty. to Him praise is due. and He is Powerful over everything. There is no god but Allah alone, Who fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and routed the confederates alone."" He then made supplication in the course of that saying such words three times. He then descended and walked towards al-Marwa, and when his feet came down in the bottom of the valley, he ran, and when he began to ascend he walked till he reached al-Marwa. There he did as he had done at al-Safa'. And when it was his last running at al-Marwa he said: If I had known beforehand what I have come to know afterwards, I would not have brought sacrificial animals and would have performed an 'Umra. So, he who among you has not the sacrificial animals with him should put off Ihram and treat it as an Umra. Suraqa bin Malik bin Ju'sham got up and said: Messenger of Allah, does it apply to the present year, or does it apply forever? Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) intertwined the fingers (of one hand) into another and said twice: The 'Umra has become incorporated in the Hajj (adding):"" No, but for ever and ever."" 'All came from the Yemen with the sacrificial animals for the Prophet (ﷺ) and found Fatimah (رضی اللہ عنہا) to be one among those who had put off Ihram and had put on dyed clothes and had applied antimony. He (Hadrat 'Ali رضی اللہ عنہ) showed disapproval to it, whereupon she said: My father has commanded me to do this. He (the narrator) said that 'Ali رضی اللہ عنہ used to say in Iraq: I went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) showing annoyance at Fatimah for what she had done, and asked the (verdict) of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) regarding what she had narrated from him, and told him that I was angry with her, whereupon he said: She has told the truth, she has told the truth. (The Prophet then asked 'Ali): What did you say when you undertook to go for Hajj? I ('Ali رضی اللہ عنہ) said: O Allah, I am putting on Ihram for the same purpose as Thy Messenger has put it on. He said: I have with me sacrificial animals, so do not put off the Ihram. He (Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ) said: The total number of those sacrificial animals brought by 'Ali from the Yemen and of those brought by the Apostle (ﷺ) was one hundred. Then all the people except the Apostle (ﷺ) and those who had with them sacrificial animals, put off Ihram, and got their hair clipped; when it was the day of Tarwiya (8th of Dhu'l-Hijja) they went to Mina and put on the Ihram for Hajj and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) rode and led the noon, afternoon, sunset 'Isha' and dawn prayers. He then waited a little till the sun rose, and commanded that a tent of hair should be pitched at Namira. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then set out and the Quraish did not doubt that he would halt at al-Mash'ar al-Haram (the sacred site) as the Quraish used to do in the pre-Islamic period. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), however, passed on till he came to 'Arafa and he found that the tent had been pitched for him at Namira. There he got down till the sun had passed the meridian; he commanded that al-Qaswa should be brought and saddled for him. Then he came to the bottom of the valley, and addressed the people saying: Verily your blood, your property are as sacred and inviolable as the sacredness of this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this town of yours. Behold! Everything pertaining to the Days of Ignorance is under my feet completely abolished. Abolished are also the blood-revenges of the Days of Ignorance. The first claim of ours on blood-revenge which I abolish is that of the son of Rabi'a bin al-Harith, who was nursed among the tribe of Sa'd and killed by Hudhail. And the usury of she pre-Islamic period is abolished, and the first of our usury I abolish is that of 'Abbas bin 'Abdul-Muttalib, for it is all abolished. Fear Allah concerning women! Verily you have taken them on the security of Allah, and intercourse with them has been made lawful unto you by words of Allah. You too have right over them, and that they should not allow anyone to sit on your bed whom you do not like. But if they do that, you can chastise them but not severely. Their rights upon you are that you should provide them with food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you the Book of Allah, and if you hold fast to it, you would never go astray. And you would be asked about me (on the Day of Resurrection), (now tell me) what would you say? They (the audience) said: We will bear witness that you have conveyed (the message), discharged (the ministry of Prophethood) and given wise (sincere) counsel. He (the narrator) said: He (the Holy Prophet) then raised his forefinger towards the sky and pointing it at the people (said):"" O Allah, be witness. O Allah, be witness,"" saying it thrice. (Bilal then) pronounced Adhan and later on Iqama and he (the Holy Prophet) led the noon prayer. He (Bilal) then uttered Iqama and he (the Holy Prophet) led the afternoon prayer and he observed no other prayer in between the two. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then mounted his camel and came to the place of stay, making his she-camel al-Qaswa, turn towards the side where there we are rocks, having the path taken by those who went on foot in front of him, and faced the Qibla. He kept standing there till the sun set, and the yellow light had somewhat gone, and the disc of the sun had disappeared. He made Usama رضی اللہ عنہ sit behind him, and he pulled the nosestring of Qaswa so forcefully that its head touched the saddle (in order to keep her under perfect control), and he pointed out to the people with his right hand to be moderate (in speed), and whenever he happened to pass over an elevated tract of sand, he slightly loosened it (the nose-string of his camel) till she climbed up and this is how he reached al-Muzdalifa. There he led the evening and 'Isha prayers with one Adhan and two Iqamas and did not glorify (Allah) in between them (i.e. he did not observe supererogatory rak'ahs between Maghrib and 'Isha' prayers). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then lay down till dawn and offered the dawn prayer with an Adhan and Iqama when the morning light was clear. He again mounted al-Qaswa, and when he came to al-Mash'ar al-Haram, he faced towards Qibla, supplicated Him, Glorified Him, and pronounced His Uniqueness (La ilaha illa Allah) and Oneness, and kept standing till the daylight was very clear. He then went quickly before the sun rose, and seated behind him was al-Fadl bin 'Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ and he was a man having beautiful hair and fair complexion and handsome face. As the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was moving on, there was also going a group of women (side by side with them). Al-Fadl began to look at them. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) placed his hand on the face of Fadl رضی اللہ عنہ who then turned his face to the other side, and began to see, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) turned his hand to the other side and placed it on the face of al-Fadl رضی اللہ عنہ . He again turned his face to the other side till he came to the bottom of Muhassir. 1680 He urged her (al-Qaswa) a little, and, following the middle road, which comes out at the greatest jamra, he came to the jamra which is near the tree. At this be threw seven small pebbles, saying Allah-O-Akbar while throwing every one of them in a manner in which the small pebbles are thrown (with the help of fingers) and this he did in the bottom of the valley. He then went to the place of sacrifice, and sacrificed sixty-three (camels) with his own hand. Then he gave the remaining number to 'All who sacrificed them, and he shared him in his sacrifice. He then commanded that a piece of flesh from each animal sacrificed should be put in a pot, and when it was cooked, both of them (the Prophet and Hadrat 'Ali) took some meat out of it and drank its soup. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) again rode and came to the House, and offered the Zuhr prayer at Mecca. He came to the tribe of Abdul-Muttalib, who were supplying water at Zamzam, and said: Draw water. O Bani 'Abd al-Muttalib; were it not that people would usurp this right of supplying water from you, I would have drawn it along with you. So they handed him a basket and he drank from it.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2951,Ja'far bin Muhammad narrated on the authority of his father thus:,"I came to Jabir bin Abdullah رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ and asked him about the (Farewell) Pilgrimage of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). The rest of the hadith is the same, but with the addition of this: There was one Abu Sayyara among the Arabs, (of pre-Islamic period) who carried (people from Muzdalifa to Mini). As the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) set out from Muzdalifa to al-Mash'ar al-Haram, the Quraish were certain that he would halt there and that would be his station. But he passed on (without staying) there. and paid no heed to it till he came to 'Arafat and there he stayed.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2952,Jabir رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:,"I have sacrificed (the animals) here, and the whole of Mini is a place for sacrifice; so sacrifice your animals at your places. 1 have stayed here (near these rocks), and the whole of Arafat is a place for stay. And I have stayed here (at Muzdalifa near Mash'ar al-Haram and the whole of Muzdalifa) is a place for stay (i. e. one is permitted to spend night in any part of it, as one likes).",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2953,Jabir bin Abdullah ( رضی اللہ عنہ) reported:,"When Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) proceeded to Mecca, he came to it (the Black Stone). he kissed it. and moved to his right. and moved quickly in three circuits, and walked in four circuits.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2954,A'isha (رضی اللہ عنہا) reported:,"The Quraish (of the pre-Islamic days) and those who followed their religions practices stayed at Muzdalifa, and they named themselves as Hums, whereas all other Arabs stayed at 'Arafa. With the advent of Islam, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, commanded His Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) to come to 'Arafat and stay there, and then hurry from there, and this is the significance of the words of Allah: Then hasten on from where the people hasten on.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2955,Hisham narrated on the authority of his father:,"The Arabs with the exception of Hums who were Quraish, and their descendants, circumambulated the House naked. They kept circumambulating In this state of nudity unless the Hums supplied to them the clothes. The male provided (clothes) to the male and the female provided clothes to the female. And the Hums did not get out of Muzdalifa, whereas the people (other than the Quraish) went t o 'Arafat. Hisham said on the authority of his father who related from 'A'isha (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا) who said: Hums are those about whom Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse: Then hasten to where the people hasten. She (further) said: The people hastened on from 'Arafat, whereas Hums hastened from Muzdalifa, and said: We'do not hasten but from Haram. But when this (verse) was revealed: Hasten on from that (place) where the people hasten on, they (the Quraish) then went to 'Arafat.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2956,Jubair bin Mut'im رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ reported:,"I lost my camel and went in search of it on the day of 'Arafa, and I saw the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) staying along with people in 'Ara'fit. Thereupon I said: By Allah, he is among the Hums (Quraish) ; what has happened to him that he has come to this (place)? The Quraish were counted among Hums.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2957,Abu Musa (رضی اللہ عنہ) said:,"I came to the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) as he was encamping at Batha. He said to me: Did you intend to perform Hajj? I said: Yes. He again said: With what intention have you entered into the state of Ihram (for Ifrad, Qiran or Tamattu'). I said: I pronounced Talbiya (I have entered into the state of Ihram ) with that very aim with which the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) is pronouncing Talbiya. He (the Holy Prophet) said; You have done well. Then circumambulate the House and run between al-Safa' and al-Marwa' and put off Ihram (as you have not brought the sacrificial animals along with you). So I circumambulated the House, and ran between al-Safa' and al-Marwa' and then came to a woman of the tribe of Qais and she rid my head of the lice. I again put on Ihram for Hajj. and continued giving religious verdict (according to this practice) till during the Caliphate of Umar (Allah be pleased with him) when a person said to him: Abu Musa, or Abdullah bin Qais, exercise restraint in delivering some religious verdict of yours, for you do not know what has been introduced after you by the Commander of the Believers in the rites (of Hajj). Thereupon he said: 0 people, whom we gave the religious verdict (concerning putting off Ihram ) they should wait, for the Commander of the Believers is about to come to you, and you should follow him. Umar (رضی اللہ عنہ) then came and I made a mention of it to him. whereupon he said: If we abide by the Book of Allah (we find) the Book of Allah has commanded us to complete the (. Hajj and 'Umra), and if we abide by the Sunnah of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ), we find that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) did not put off Ihram till the sacrificial animal was brought to its end (till it was sacrificed).",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih

I said: I have entered into the state of Ihram in accordance with the Ihram of Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). He said: Have you brought sacrificial animals along with you? I said: No. whereupon he said: Then circumambulate the House and run between al-Safa' and al-Marwa and put off Ihram. So I circumambulated the House, ran between al-Safa' and al-Marwa, and then came to a woman of my tribe. She combed and washed my head. I used to give religious verdict (according to the above mentioned command of the Holy Prophet) during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ and also during that of 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ . And it was during the Hajj season that a person came to me and said: You (perhaps) do not know what the Commander of the Believers has introduced in the rites (of Hajj). I said: 0 people, those whom we have given religious verdict about a certain thing should wait, for the Commander of the Believers is about to arrive among you, so follow him. When the Commander of the Believers arrived, I said: What is this that you have introduced in the rites (of Hajj)? -where upon he said: If we abide by the Book of Allah (we find) that there Allah, Exalted and Majestic, has said: Complete Hajj and 'Umra for Allah.
