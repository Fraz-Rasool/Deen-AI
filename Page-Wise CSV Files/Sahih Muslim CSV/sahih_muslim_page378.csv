2150,Abdullah bin Abu Mulaika said:,"The daughter of 'Uthman bin 'Affan رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ died in Mecca. We came to attend her (funeral). Ibn 'Umar and Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ were also present there, and I was sitting between them. He added: I (first sat) by the side of one of them, then the other one came and he sat by my side. 'Abdullah bin 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said to 'Amr bin 'Uthman who was sitting opposite to him: Will you not prevent the people from lamenting, for the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had said: The dead is punished because of the lamenting of his family for him ? Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ then said that Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ used to say someting of that nature, and then narrated saying: I proceeded from Mecca along with 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ till we reached al-Baida' and there was a party of riders under the shade of a tree. He said (to me): Go and find out who this party is. I cast a glance and there was Suhaib رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ (in that party). So I informed him ('Umar) about it. He said: Call him to me. So I went back to Suhaib and said: Go and meet the Commander of the believers. When 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ was wounded, Suhaib came walling: Alas, for the brother! alas for the companion! 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said: O Suhaib, do you wail for me, whereas the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: The dead would be punished on account of the lamentation of the (members of his family) ? Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said: When 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ died I made a mention of it to 'A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا . She said: May Allah have mercy upon 'Umar! I swear by Allah that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) never said that Allah would punish the believer because of the weeping (of any one of the members of his family), but he said that Allah would increase the punishment of the unbeliever because of the weeping of his family over him. 'A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا said: The Qur'an is enough for you (when it states): No bearer of burden will bear another's burden (vi. 164). Thereupon Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said: Allah is He Who has caused laughter and weeping. Ibn Abu Mulaika said: By Allah, Ibn 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said nothing.",The Book of Prayer - Funerals,Sahih Muslim,2,Sahih
2151,Amr reported on the authority of Ibn Abu Mulaika:,"We were with the bier of Umm Aban, daughter of 'Uthman رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ , and the rest of the hadith is the same, but he did not narrate it as a marfu' hadith on the authority of 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ from the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) as it was narrated by Ayyub and Ibn Juraij, and the hadith narrated by them (Ayyub and Ibn Juraij) is more complete than that of 'Amr.",The Book of Prayer - Funerals,Sahih Muslim,2,Sahih
2152,Abdullah bin 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ reported:,The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: The dead is punished because of the lamentation of the living.,The Book of Prayer - Funerals,Sahih Muslim,2,Sahih
2153,Hisham bin 'Urwa narrated on the authority of his father:,"The saying of Ibn 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ , viz. The dead would be punished because of the lamentation of his family over him was mentioned to 'A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا . Upon this she said: May Allah have mercy upon Abu 'AbdUl-Rahman (the kunya of Ibn 'Umar) that he heard something but could not retain it (well). (The fact is) that the bier of a Jew passed before the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and (the members of his family) were waiting over him. Upon this he said: You are wailing and he is being punished.",The Book of Prayer - Funerals,Sahih Muslim,2,Sahih
2154,Hisham narrated on the authority of his father:,"It was mentioned to 'A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا that Ibn 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ had narrated as marfu' hadith from the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) that the dead would be punished in the grave because of the lamentation of his family for him. Upon this she said: He (Ibn 'Umar) missed (the point). The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had (in fact) said: He (the dead) is punished for his faults or for his sins, and the members of his family are wailing for him now. (This misunderstanding of Ibn 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ is similar to his saying: ) The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) stood by the well in which were lying the dead bodies of those polytheists who had been killed on the Day of Badr, and he said to them what he had to say, i. e.: They hear what I say. But he (Ibn 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ) misunderstood. The Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had only said: They (the dead) understand that what I used to say to them was truth. She then recited: Certainly, thou canst not make the dead hear the call (xxvii. 80), nor can you make those hear who are in the graves, nor can you inform them when they have taken their seats in Hell.",The Book of Prayer - Funerals,Sahih Muslim,2,Sahih

Upon this 'A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا said: May Allah have mercy upon the father of 'Abdul-Rahman (Ibn 'Umar). He did not tell a lie, but he forgot or made a mistake. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) happened to pass by a (dead) Jewess who was being lamented. Upon this he said: They weep over her and she is being punished in the grave.",The Book of Prayer - Funerals,Sahih Muslim,2,Sahih
