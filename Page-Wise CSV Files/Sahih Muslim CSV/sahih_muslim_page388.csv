He replied: Messenger of Allah, I said: Does good produce evil? The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said to him: The good does not produce but good. but among the plants the spring rain produces There some which kill with a tremour or nearly kill all but the animal which feeds on vegetation. It eats and when its flanks are distended, it faces the can. then when it has donged or urinated and chewed it returns and eats.

Allah would grant him power to endure, and none is blessed with an endowment better and greater than endurance.",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
