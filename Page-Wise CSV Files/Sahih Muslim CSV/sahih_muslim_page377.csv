2149,Abdullah bin Abu Mulaika reported:,"I was sitting by the side of Ibn 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ , and we were waiting for the bier of Umm Aban, daughter of 'Uthman رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ , and there was also 'Amr bin 'Uthman. In the meanwhile there came Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ led by a guide. I conceive that he was informed of the place of Ibn 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ . So he came till he sat by my side. While I was between them (Ibn 'Abbas and Ibn 'Umar) there came the noise (of wailing) from the house. Upon this Ibn 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said (that is, he pointed out to 'Amr that he should stand and forbid them, for): I heard the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) as saying: The dead is punished because of the lamentation of his family. 'Abdullah رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ made it general (what was said for a particular occasion). Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said: When we were with the Commander of the believers, 'Umar b Khattab رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ , we reached Baida', and there was a man under the shadow of the tree. He said to me: Go and inform me who is that person. So I went and (found) that he was Suhaib رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ . I returned to him and said: You commanded me to find out for you who that was, and he is Suhaib رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ . He (Hadrat 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ ) said: Command him to see us. I said: He has family along with him. He said: (That is of no account) even if he has family along with him. So he (the narrator) told him to see (the Commander of the believers and his party). When we came (to Medina), it was before long that the Commander of the believers was wounded, and Suhaib رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ came weeping and crying: Alas for the brother, alas for the companion. Upon this 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said: Didn't you know, or didn't you hear, that the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: The dead is punished because of the lamentation of his family ? Then 'Abdullah رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ made it general and 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ told it of certain occasions. So I ('Abdullah bin Abu Mulaika) stood up and went to 'A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا and told her what Ibn 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ had said. Upon this she said: I swear by Allah that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) never said that dead would be punished because of his family's lamenting (for him). What he said was that Allah would increase the punishment of the unbeliever because of his family's lamenting for him. Verily it is Allah Who has caused laughter and weeping. No bearer of a burden will bear another's burden. Ibn Abu Mulaika said that al-Qasim bin Muhammad said that when the words of 'Umar and Ibn 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ were conveyed to 'A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا , she said: You have narrated it to me from those who are neither liar nor those suspected of lying but (sometimes) hearing misleads.",The Book of Prayer - Funerals,Sahih Muslim,2,Sahih
