Most of them, nay, all of them, belonged to the tribe of Mudar. The colour of the face of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) underwent a change when he saw them in poverty. He then entered (his house) and came out and commanded Bilal (to pronounce Adhan).

(He then recited) a verse of Sura Hashr: Fear Allah. and let every soul consider that which it sends forth for the morrow and fear Allah (lix. 18). (Then the audience began to vie with one another in giving charity.) Some donated a dinar, others a dirham, still others clothes, some donated a sa' of wheat, some a sa' of dates; till he (the Holy Prophet) said: (Bring) even if it is half a date. Then a person from among the Ansar came there with a money bag which his hands could scarcely lift; in fact, they could not (lift). Then the people followed continuously, till I saw two heaps of eatables and clothes, and I saw the face of the Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) glistening, like gold (on account of joy). The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: He who sets a good precedent in Islam, there is a reward for him for this (act of goodness) and reward of that also who acted according to it subsequently, without any deduction from their rewards; and he who sets in Islam an evil precedent, there is upon him the burden of that, and the burden of him also who acted upon it subsequently, without any deduction from their burden.",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
