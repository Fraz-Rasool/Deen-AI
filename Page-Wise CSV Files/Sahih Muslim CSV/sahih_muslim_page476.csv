4600,It has been narrated on the authority of 'A'isha رضی اللہ عنہا :,"Sa'd's رضی اللہ عنہ wound became dry and was going to heal when he prayed: O God, surely Thou knowest that nothing is dearer to me than that I should fight for Thy cause against the people who disbeliever Your Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and turned him out (from his native place). If anything yet remains to be decided from the war against the Quraish, spare my life so that I may fight against them in Thy cause. O Lord, I think Thou hast ended the war between us and them. If Thou hast done so, open my wound (so that it may discharge) and cause my death thereby. So the wound begin to bleed from the front part of his neck. The people were not scared except when the blood flowed towards them, and in the mosque along with Sa'd's رضی اللہ عنہ tent was the tent of Banu Ghifar. They said: O people of the tent, what is it that is coming to us from you? Lo! it was Sa'd's رضی اللہ عنہ wound that was bleeding and he died thereof.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4601,This tradition has been narrated by Hisham through the same chain of transmitters with a little difference in the wording. He said:,"(His wound) began to bleed that very night and it continued to bleed until he died. He has made the addition that it was then that (a non-believing) poet said: Hark, O Sa'd, Sa'd of Banu Mu'adh, What have the Quraiaa and Nadir done? By thy life! Sa'd bin Mu'adh>br> Was steadfast on the morn they departed. You have left your cooking-pot empty, While the cooking-pot of the people is hot and boiling. Abu Hubab the nobleman has said, O Qainuqa', do not depart. They were weighty in their country just aa rocks are weighty in Maitan.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4602,It has been narrated on the authority of Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہ who said:,"On the day he returned from the Battle of Ahzab, the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) made for us an announcement that nobody would say his Zuhr prayer but in the quarters of Banu Quraiza (Some) people, being afraid that the time for prayer would expire, said their prayers before reaching the street of Banu Quraiza. The others said: We will not say our prayer except where the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) has ordered us to say it even if the time expires. When he learned of the difference in the view of the two groups of the people, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not blame anyone from the two groups.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4603,It has been narrated on the authority of Anas bin Malik رضی اللہ عنہ who said:,"When the Muhajirs migrated from Mecca to Medina; they came (in a state that) they had not anything (i.e. money) in their hands, while the Ansar possessed lands and date palms. They divided their properties with the Muhajirs. The Ansar divided and gave them on the condition that they would give half the fruit from the orchards every year, and the Muhajirs would recompense them by working with them and putting in labor. The mother of Anas bin Malik رضی اللہ عنہ was called Umm Sulaim رضی اللہ عنہا and she was also the mother of 'Abdullah bin Talha who was a brother of Anas رضی اللہ عنہ from his mother's side. The mother of Anas رضی اللہ عنہ had given the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) her date-palms. He bestowed them upon Umm Aiman, the slave-girl who had been freed by him and was the mother of Usama bin Zaid رضی اللہ عنہ . When the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) had finished the war with the people of Khaibar and returned to Medina, the Muhajirs returned to the Ansar all the gifts which they had given them out of the fruits. (Anas bin Malik رضی اللہ عنہ said: ) The Messenger of. Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) returned to my mother her date-palms and gave to Umm Aiman رضی اللہ عنہا instead of them date-palms from his orchard. Ibn Shihab says that Umm Aiman رضی اللہ عنہا was the mother of Usama bin Zaid رضی اللہ عنہ who was the slave-girl of 'Abdullah bin 'Abdul-Muttalib and hailed from Abyssinia. When Amina gave birth to the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) after the death of his father, Umm Aiman رضی اللہ عنہا used to nurse him until he grew up. He (later on) freed her and married her to Zaid bin Haritha رضی اللہ عنہ . She died five months after the death of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ).",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4604,It has been narrated by Anas رضی اللہ عنہ that (after his migration to Medina):,"A person placed at the Prophet's ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) disposal some date-palms growing on his land until the lands of Quraiza and Nadir were conquered. Then he began to return to him whatever he had received. (In this connection) my people told me to approach the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and ask from him what his people had given him or a portion thereof, but the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had bestowed those trees upon Umm Aiman رضی اللہ عنہا. So I came to the Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and he gave hem (back) to me. Umm Aiman رضی اللہ عنہا (also) came (at this time). She put the cloth round my neck and said: No, by Allah, we will not give to, you what he has granted to me. The Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: Umm Aiman رضی اللہ عنہا , let him have them and for you are such and such trees instead. But she said: By Allah, there is no god besides Him. No, never! The Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) continued saying: (You will get) such and such. until he had granted her ten times or nearly ten times more (than the original gift).",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4605,It has been narrated on the authority of Abdullah bin Mughaffal:,Who said I found a bag containing fat on the day of the Battle of Khaibar. I caught hold of it and said: I will not give anything today from it to anybody. Then I turned round and saw that the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) was smiling (at my words).,The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4606,'Abdullah bin Mughaffal رضی اللہ عنہ said:,"A bag containing food and fat was thrown to us. I kept forward to catch it. Then I turned round and saw (to my surprise) the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and I felt ashamed of my act in his presence. Shu'ba narrated it with this chain (a hadith similar to no. 4604), except that he said: A leader bag full of fats, and he did not mention food.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4607,It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ who learnt the tradition personally from Abu Safyan رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The latter said: I went out (on a mercantile venture) during the period (of truce) between me and the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). While I was in Syria, the letter of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) was handed over to Hiraql (Ceasar), the Emperor of Rome (who was on a visit to Jerusalem at that time). The letter was brought by Dihya Kalbi رضی اللہ عنہ who delivered it to the governor of Busra The governor passed it on to Hiraql, (On receiving the letter), he said: Is there anyone from the people of this man who thinks that he is a prophet. People said: Yes. So, I was called along with a few others from the Quraish. We were admitted to Hiraql and he seated us before him. He asked: Which of you has closer kinship with the man who thinks that he is a prophet? Abu Sufyan said: I. So they seated me in front of him and stated my companions behind me. Then, he called his interpreter and said to him: Tell them that I am going to ask this fellow (i. e. Abu Sufyan) about the man who thinks that he is a prophet. It he tells me a lie, then refute him. Abu Sufyan told (the narrator): By God, if there was not the fear that falsehood would be imputed to me I would have lied. (Then) Hiraqi said to his interpreter: Inquire from him about his ancestry, I said: He is of good ancestry among us. He asked: Has there been a king among his ancestors? I said: No. He asked: Did you accuse him of falsehood before he proclaimed his prophethood? I said: No. He asked: Who are his follower people of high status or low status? I said: (They are) of low status. He asked: Are they increasing in number or decreasing? I said. No. they are rather increasing. He asked: Does anyone give up his religion, being dissatisfied with it, after having embraced it? I said: No. He asked: Have you been at war with him? I said: Yes. He asked: How did you fare in that war? I said: The war between us and him has been wavering like a bucket, up at one turn and down at the other (i. e. the victory has been shared between us and him by turns). Sometimes he suffered loss at our hands and sometimes we suffered loss at his (hand). He asked: Has he (ever) violated his covenant? I said: No. but we have recently concluded a peace treaty with him for a petiod and we do not know what he is going to do about it. (Abu Sufyin said on oath that he could not interpolate in this dialogue anything from himself more than these words ) He asked: Did anyone make the proclamation (Of prophethood) before him? I said: No. He (now) said to his interpreter: Tell him, I asked him about his ancestry and he had replied that he had the best ancestry. This is the case with Prophets; they are the descendants of the noblest among their people (Addressing Abu Sufyan), he continued: I asked you if there had been a king among his ancestors. You said that there had been none. If there had been a king among his ancestors, I would have said that he was a man demanding his ancestral kingdom. I asked you about his followers whether they were people of high or low status, and you said that they were of rather low status. Such are the followers of the Prophets. I asked you whether you used to accuse him of falsehood before he proclaimed his prophethood, and you said that you did not. So I have understood that when he did not allow himself to tell a lie about the poeple, he would never go to the length of forging a falsehood about Allah. I asked you whether anyone renounced his religion being dissatisfied with it after he had embraced it, and you replied in the negative. Faith is like this when it enters the depth of the heart (it perpetuates them). I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You said they were increasing. Faith is like this until it reaches its consummation. I asked you whether you had been at war with him, and you replied that you had been and that the victory between you and him had been shared by turns, sometimes he suffering loss at your hand and sometimes you suffering lost at his. This is how the Prophets are tried before the final victory its theirs. I asked you whether he (ever) violated his covenant, and you said that he did not. This is how the Prophets behave. They never violate (their covenants). I asked you whether anyone before him had proclaimed the same thing, and you replied in the negative. I said: If anyone had made the same proclamation before, I would have thought that he was a man following what had been proclaimed before. (Then) he asked: What does he enjoin upon you? I said: He exhorts us to offer Salat, to pay Zakat, to show due regard to kinship and to practise chastity. He said: It what you have told about him is true, he is certainly a Prophet. I knew that he was to appear but I did not think that he would be from among you. If I knew that I would be able to reach him. I would love to meet him; and it I had been with him. I would have washed his feet (out of reverence). His dominion would certainly extend to this place which is under my feet. Then he called for the letter of the Messenger of Allah (may pface be upon him) and read it. The letter ran as follows: In the name of Allah, Most Gracious and Most Merciful. From Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, to Hiraql, the Emperor of the Romans. Peace be upon him who follows the guidance. After this, I extend to you the invitation to accept Islam. Embrace Islam and you will be safe. Accept Islam, God will give you double the reward. And if you turn away, upon you will be the sin of your subjects. O People of the Book, come to the word that is common between us that we should worship none other than Allah, should not ascribe any partner to Him and some of us should not take their fellows as Lords other than Allah. If they turn away, you should say that we testify to our being Muslims [iii. 64]. When he hid finished the reading of the letter, noise and confused clamour was raise around him, and he ordered us to leave. Accordingly, we left. (Addressing my companions) while we were coming out (of the place). I said: Ibn Abu Kabsha (referring sarcastically to the Holy Prophet) has come to wield a great power. Lo! (even) the king of the Romans is afraid of him. I continued to believe that the authority of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) would triumph until God imbued me with (the spirit of) Islam.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4608,This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Shihab with the same chain of transmitters but with the addition:,"When Allah inflicted defeat on the armies of Persia, Caesar moved from Hims to Aelia (Bait al-Maqdis) for thanking Allah as He granted him victory. In this hadith these words occur: From Muhammad, servant of Allah and His Messenger, and said: The sin of your followers, and also said the words: to the call of Islam .",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4609,It has been narrated on the authority of Anas رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) wrote to Chosroes (King of Persia), Caesar (Emperor of Rome), Negus (King of Abyssinia) and every (other) despot inviting them to Allah, the Exalted. And this Negus was not the one for whom the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had said the funeral prayers.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4610,"The tradition has been narrated on the authority of Anas bin Malik رضی اللہ عنہ (the same narrator) through a different chain of transmitters, but this version does not mention:",And he was not the Negus for whom the Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had said the funeral prayers.,The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4611,"It was narrated from Qatadah, from Anas رضی اللہ عنہ (a similar report as no. 4609), but he did not say:",That was not the Negus for whom the prophet ﷺ offered the funeral prayer ( similar report as no. 4609).,The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4612,It has been narrated on the authority of 'Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ who said:,"I was in the company of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) on the Day of Hunain. I and Abu Sufyan bin Harith bin 'Abdul-Muttalib رضی اللہ عنہ stuck to the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and we did not separate from him. And the Messenger of Allah (may place be upon him) was riding on his white mule which had been presented to him by Farwa bin Nufitha al-Judhami. When the Muslims had an encounter with the disbelievers, the Muslims fled, falling back, but the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) began to spur his mule towards the disbelievers. I was holding the bridle of the mule of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) checking it from going very fast, and Abu Sufyan رضی اللہ عنہ was holding the stirrup of the (mule of the) Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌), who said: Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ , call out to the people of al-Samura. Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ (who was a man with a loud voice) called out at the top of the voice: Where are the people of Samura? (Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ said: ) And by God, when they heard my voice, they came back (to us) as cows come back to their calves, and said: We are present, we are present! 'Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ said: They began to fight the infidels. Then there was a call to The Ansar. Those (who called out to them) shouted: O ye party of the Ansar! O party of the Ansar! Banu al-Harith b. al-Khazraj were the last to be called. Those (who called out to them) shouted: O Banu Al-Harith bin al-Khazraj! O Banu Harith bin al-Khazraj! And the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) who was riding on his mule looked at their fight with his neck stretched forward and he said: This is the time when the fight is raging hot. Then the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) took (some) pebbles and threw them in the face of the infidels. Then he said: By the Lord of Muhammad, the infidels are defeated. 'Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ said: I went round and saw that the battle was in the same condition in which I had seen it. By Allah, it remained in the same condition until he threw the pebbles. I continued to watch until I found that their force had been spent out and they began to retreat.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4613,A similar report (as no.4612) was narrated from Az-Zuhri with this chain except that he said:,"They have been defeated, by Lord of the Ka'ba, they have been defeated, by Lord of the Ka'ba. And there is at the end the addition of the words: Until Allah defeated them (and I imagine) as if I saw the Prophet of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) chasing them on his mule.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4614,Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,I was with Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) on the Day of Hunain.

4615,It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Ishaq who said:,"A man asked Bara' (bin 'Azib) رضی اللہ عنہ : Did you run away on the Day of Hunain. O, Abu Umira? He said: No, by Allah, The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) did not turn his back; (what actually happened was that) some young men from among his companions, who were hasty and who were either without any arms or did not have abundant arms, advanced and met a party of archers (who were so good shots) that their arrows never missed the mark. This party (of archers) belonged to Banu Hawazin and Banu Nadir. They shot at the advancing young men and their arrows were not likely to miss their targets. So these young men turned to the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) while he was riding on his white mule and Abu Sufyan bin al-Harith bin 'Abdul-Muttalib رضی اللہ عنہ was leading him. (At this) he got down from his mule, invoked God's help, and called out: I am the Prophet. This is no untruth. I am the son of 'Abdul-Muttalib.

(What actually happened was that some hasty young men who were either inadequately armed or were unarmed met a group of men from Banu Hawazin and Banu Nadir who happened to be (excellent) archers. The latter shot at them a volley of arrows that did not miss. The people turned to the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). Abu Sufyan bin Harith رضی اللہ عنہ was leading his mule. So he got down, prayed and invoked God's help. He said: I am the Prophet. This is no untruth. I am the son of Abd al-Muttalib. O God, descend Thy help. Bara' رضی اللہ عنہ continued: When the battle grew fierce. we, by God. would seek protection by his side, and the bravest among us was he who confronted the onslaught and it was the Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ).",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih

Bara' رضی اللہ عنہ said: But the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) did not run away. On that day Banu Hawzzin took part in the battle as archers (on the side of the disbelievers). When we attacked them, they retreated and we fell upon the booty; (they rallied) and advanced towards us with arrows. (At that time) I saw the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) riding on his white mule and Abu Sufyan bin al-Harith رضی اللہ عنہ was holding its bridle.

4619,"Iyas bin Salama, who was the one of Al-Akwa', said:","We fought by the side of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) at Hunain. When we encountered the enemy, I advanced and ascended a hillock. A man from the enemy side turned towards me and I shot him with an arrow. He (ducked and) hid himself from me. I could not understand what he did, but (all of a sudden) I saw that a group of people appeared from the other hillock. They and the Companions of the Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) met in combat, but the Companions of the Prophet turned back and I too turned back defeated. I had two mantles, one of which I was wrapping round the waist (covering the lower part of my body) and the other I was putting around my shoulders. My waist-wrapper got loose and I held the two mantles together. (In this downcast condition) I passed by the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) who was riding on his white mule. He said: The son of Akwa' finds himself to be utterly perplexed. Wher. the Companions gathered round him from all sides. the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) got down from his mule. picked up a handful of dust from the ground, threw it into their (enemy) faces and said: May these faces be deformed 1 There was no one among the enemy whose eyes were not filled with the dust from this handful.

4621,It has been narrated on the authority of Anas رضی اللہ عنہ :,"When (the news of) the advance of Abu Sufyan رضی اللہ عنہ (at the head of a force) reached him. the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) held consultations with his Companions. The narrator said: Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ spoke (expressing his own views), but he (the Holy Prophet) did not pay heed to him. Then spoke 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ (expressing his views), but he (the Holy Prophet) did not pay heed to him (too). Then Sa'd bin 'Ubada رضی اللہ عنہ stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, you want us (to speak). By God in Whose control is my life, if you order us to plunge our horses into the sea, we would do so. If you order us to goad our horses to the most distant place like Bark al-Ghimad, we would do so. The narrator said: Now the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) called upon the people (for the encounter). So they set out and encamped at Badr. (Soon) the water-carriers of the Quraish arrived. Among them was a black slave belonging to Banu al-Hajjaj. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) caught him and interrogated him about Abu Sufyan and his companions. He said: I know nothing about Abu Sufyan, but Abu Jahl, Utba, Shaiba and Umayya b. Khalaf are there. When he said this, they beat him. Then he said: All right, I will tell you about Abu Sufyan. They would stop beating him and then ask him (again) about Abu Sufyan. He would again say', I know nothing about Abu Sufyan, but Abu Jahl. 'Utba, Shaiba and Umayya b. Khalaf are there.

4622,"It has been narrated by 'Abdullah bin Rabah from Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ , who said:","Many deputations came to Mu'awiya رضی اللہ عنہ . This was in the month of Ramadan. We would prepare food for one another. Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ was one of those who frequently invited us to his house. I said: Should I not prepare food and invite them to my place? So I ordered meals to be prepared Then I met Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ in the evening and said: (You will have) your meals with me tonight. He said: You have forestalled me. I said: Yes, and invited them. (When they had finished with the meals) Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ said: Should I not tell yon a tradition from your traditions, O ye assembly of the Ansar? He then gave an account of the Conquest of Mecca and said: The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) advanced until he reached Mecca. He deputed Zubair on his right flank and Khalid رضی اللہ عنہ on the left, and he dispatched Abu Ubaida رضی اللہ عنہ with the force that had no armour. They advanced to the interior of the valley. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) was in the midst of a large contingent of fighters. He saw me and said: Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ . I said: I am here at your call, Messenger of Allah I He said: Let no one come to me except the Ansar, so call to me the Ansar (only). Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ continued: So they gathered round him. The Quraish also gathered their ruffians and their (lowly) followers, and said: We send these forward. If they get anything, we shall be with them (to share it), and if misfortune befalls them, we shall pay (as compensation) whatever we are asked for. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said (to the Ansar): You see the ruffians and the (lowly) followers of the Quraish. And he indicated by (striking) one of his hands over the other that they should be killed and said: Meet me at as-Safa. Then we went on (and) if any one of us wanted that a certain person should be killed, he was killed, and none could offer any resistance. Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ continued: Then came Abu Sufyan رضی اللہ عنہ and said: Messenger of Allah, the blood of the Quraish has become very cheap. There will be no Quraish from this day on. Then he (the Holy Prophet) said: Who enters the house of Abu Sufyan رضی اللہ عنہ , he will be safe. Some of the Ansar whispered among themselves: (After all), love for his city and tenderness towards his relations have overpowered him. Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ said: (At this moment) revelation came to the Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and when he was going to receive the Revelation, we understood it, and when he was (actually) receiving it, none of us would dare raise his eyes to the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) until the revelation came to an end. When the revelation came to an end, the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: O ye Assembly of the Ansar! They said: Here we are at your disposal, Messenger of Allah. He said: You were saying that love for his city and tenderness towards his people have overpowered this man. They said: So it was. He said: No, never. I am a bondman of God and His Messenger. I migrated towards God and towards you. I will live with you and will die with you. So, they (the Ansar) turned towards him in tears and they were saying: By Allah, we said what we said because of our tenacious attachment to Allah and His Messenger. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Surely, Allah and His Messenger testify to your assertions and accept your apology. The narrator continued: People turned to the house of Abu Sufyan رضی اللہ عنہ and people locked their doors. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) proceeded until he approached the (Black) Stone. He kissed it and circumambulated the Ka'ba. He reached near an idol by the side of the Ka'ba which was worshipped by the people. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had a bow in his hand, and he was holding it from a corner. When he came near the idol, he began to pierce its eyes with the bow and (while doing so) was saying: Truth has been established and falsehood has perished. When he had finished the circumambulation, he came to Safa', ascended it to a height from where he could see the Ka'ba, raised his hands (in prayer) and began to praise Allah and prayed what he wanted to pray.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4623,Sulaiman bin Al-Mughirah narrated it with this chain (a similar Hadith as no. 4622) and added:,"(i) Then be (the Messenger of Allah) said with his hands one upon the other: Kill them (who stand in your way).... (ii) They (the Ansar) replied: We said so, Messenger of Allah! He said: What is my name? I am but Allah's bondman and His Messenger.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4624,It has been narrated on the authority of Abdullah bin Rabah who said:,"We came to Mu'awiya bin Abu Sufyan رضی اللہ عنہ as a deputation and Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ was among us. Each of us would prepare food for his companions turn by turn for a day. (Accordingly) when it was my turn I said: Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ , it is my turn today. So they came to my place. The food was not yet ready, so I said to Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ : I wish you could narrate to us a tradition from the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) until the food was ready. (Complying with my request) Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ said: We were with the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) on the day of the Conquest of Mecca. He appointed Khalid bin Walid رضی اللہ عنہ as commander of the right flank, Zubair رضی اللہ عنہ as commander of the left flank, and Abu 'Ubaida رضی اللہ عنہ as commander of the foot-soldiers (who were to advance) to the interior of the valley. He (then) said: Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ , call the Ansar to me. So I called out to them and they came hurriedly. He said: O ye Assembly of the Ansaar, do you see the ruffians of the Quraish? They said: Yes. He said: See, when you meet them tomorrow, wipe them out. He hinted at this with his hand, placing his right hand on his left and said: You will meet us at as-Safa'. (Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ continued): Whoever was seen by them that day was put to death. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) ascended the mount of as-Safa'. The Ansar also came there and surrounded the mount. Then came Abu Sufyan رضی اللہ عنہ and said: Messenger ot Allah, the Quraish have perished. No member of the Quraish tribe will survive this day. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Who enters the house of Abu Safyin will be safe, who lays down arms will be safe, who locks his door will be safe. (some of) the Ansar said: (After all) the man has been swayed by tenderness towards his family and love for his city. At this, Divine inspiration descended upon the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). He said: You were saying that the man has been swayed by tenderness towards his family and love for his city. Do you know what my name is? I am Muhammad, the bondman of God and His Messenger. (He repeated this thrice.) I left my native place for the take of Allah and joined you. So I will live with you and die with you. Now the Ansar said: By God, we said (that) only out of our greed for Allah and His Messenger. He said: Allah and His Apostle testify to you and accept your apology.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
