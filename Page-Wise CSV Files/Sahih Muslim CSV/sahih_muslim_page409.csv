'A'isha (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا) said: The flesh of cow was sent to us on the Day of Sacrifice (10th of Dhu'I-Hijja). I said. What is this? It was said: The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) sacrificed (the cow) on behalf of his wives.

2929,A'isha (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا) reported:,"We went with the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and we did not see but that he (intended to perform) Hajj (only), but when we reached Mecca we circumambulated the House; and the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) commanded that he who did not have with him a sacrificial animal should put off Ihram. She (A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا ) said: (And consequently) those who did not bring the sacrificial animals with them put off Ihram; and among his wives (too) who had not brought the sacrificial animals with them put off Ihram. A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا said: I entered my period and could not (therefore) circumambulate the House. When it was the night of Hasba she said: Messenger of Allah, people are coming back (after having performed both) Hajj and 'Umra, whereas I am coming back only with Hajj, whereupon he said: Did you not circumambulate (the Ka'ba) that very night we entered Mecca? She (A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا ) said: No, whereupon he said: Go along with your brother to Tan'im and put on the Ihram for Umra, and it is at such and such a place that you can meet (us). (In the meanwhile) Safiyya رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا (the wife of the Holy Prophet) said: I think, I will detain you (since I have entered in the monthly) period and you shall have to wait for me for the farewell circuit). Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: May you be wounded and your head shorn did you not circumambulate on the Day of Sacrifice (10th of Dhu'l-Hijja)? She said: Yes. The Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: There is no harm. You should go forward. 'A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا said: The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) was going upwards to the side of Mecca, whereas I was coming down from it, or I was going upward, whereas he was coming down.

I said: Messenger of Allah, who has annoyed you? May Allah cast him in fire I He said: Don't you know that I commanded the people to do an act, but they are hesitant. (Hakam said: I think that he said: They seem to be hesitant.)

The Apostle of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said to her on the day of march (when pilgrims come to Mina): Your circumambulation would suffice both Hajj and Umra. She, however, felt reluctant. Thereupon the Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) sent her with 'Abdul-Rahman رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ to Tan'im and she performed Umra (with separate rituals) after Hajj.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih

2937,Jabir (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ) said:,"We, in the state of lhram, came with the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) for Hajj Mufrad (with the aim of Hajj only), and 'A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا set out for Umra, and when we reached Sarif, she (Hadrat A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا ) entered in the state of monthly period; we proceeded on till we reached (Mecca) and circumambulated the Ka'ba and ran between (al-Safa) and al-Marwa; and the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) commanded that one who amongst us had no sacrificial animal with him should put off Ihram. We said: What does this putting off imply? He said: Getting out completely from the state of lhram, (so we put off Ihram), and we turned to our wives and applied perfume and put on our clothes. and we were at a four night's distance from 'Arafa. And we again put on Ihram on the day of Tarwiya (8th of Dhu'l-Hijja). The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) came to 'A'isha (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا) and found her weeping, and said: What is the matter with you? She said: The matter is that I have entered in the monthly period, and the people had put off lhram, but I did not and I did not circumambulate the House, and the people are going for Hajj now (but I can't go), whereupon he said: It is the matter which Allah has ordained for the daughters of Adam, so now take a bath and put on Ihram for Hajj. She ('A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا ) did accordingly, and stayed at the places of staying till the monthly period was over. She then circumambulated the House, and (ran between) al-Safa and al-Marwa. He (the Holy Prophet) then said: Now both your Hajj and 'Umra are complete, whereupon she said: I feel in my mind that I did not circumambulate the House till I performed Hajj (I missed the circumambulation of 'Umra). Thereupon he (Allah's Apostle) said: 'Abdul-Rahman, take her to Tan'im (so as to enable her) to perform Umra (separately), and it was the night at Hasba.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2938,Jabir bin Abdullah رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہما is reported to have said:,The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) came to 'A'isha (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا) and she was weeping. The rest of the hadith is the same.,The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih

The rest of the hadith is the same, but with this addition: The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) was a person of gentle disposition, so when she (A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا ) wished for a thing, he accepted it (provided it did not contravene the teachings of Islam). So he (in pursuance of her desire for a separate lhram for Umra) sent her with 'Abdul-Rahman bin Abu Bakr رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ and she put on Ihram for 'Umra at al-Tan'im. Matar and Abu Zubair (the two narrators amongst the chain of transmitters) said: Whenever 'A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا performed Hajj she did as she had done along with Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌).",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih

When we reached Mecca we circumambulated the House and (ran) between al-Safa and al-Marwa. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: He who has no sacrificial animal with him should put off lhram. We said: What kind of putting off? He said: Getting out of lhram completely. So we came to our wives, and put on our clothes and applied perfume. When it was the day of Tarwiya, we put on Ihram for Hajj. and the first circumambulation and (running) between al-Safa and al-Marwa sufficed us.. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) commanded us to become seven partners (in the sacrifice) of a camel and a cow.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2941,Jabir bin Abdullah رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ reported:,The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) ordered us to put on Ihram (again) as we proceeded towards Mina after we had put it off (i.e. 'on the 8th of Dhu'l-Hijja). So we pronounced Talbiya at al-Abtah.,The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2942,Jabir bin Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہ is reported to have said:,Neither Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم) nor his Companions (circumambulated the Ka'ba and) ran between al-Safa and al-Marwa but once (sufficing both for Hajj and 'Umra). But in the hadith transmitted by Muhammad bin Bakr there is an addition: That is first circumambulation. The Prophet and his companions only went between As-Safa aand Al-Marwah once.,The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2943,"Ata' reported: I, along with some people, heard Jabir bin 'Abdullah رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ saying:","We the Companions of Muhammad ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) put on Ihram for Hajj only. Ata' further said that Jabir stated: Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) came on the 4th of Dhu'l-Hijja and he commanded us to put off Ihram. 'Ata' said that he (Allah's Apostle) commanded them to put off Ihram and to go to their wives (for intercourse). 'Ata' said: It was not obligatory for them, but (intercourse) with them had become permissible. We said: When only five days had been left to reach 'Arafa, he (the Holy Prophet) commanded us to have intercourse with our wives. And we reached 'Arafa in a state as if we had just had intercourse (with them). He ('Ata') said: Jabir رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ pointed with his hand and I (perceive) as if I am seeing his hand as it moved. In the (meantime) the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) stood amongst us and said: You are well aware that I am the most God-fearing, most truthful and most pious amongst you. And if there were not sacrificial animals with me, I would also have put off Ihram as you have put off. And if I were to know this matter of mine what I have come to know later on, I would not have brought sacrificial animals with me. So they (the Companions) put off Ihram and we also put it off and listened to (the Holy Prophet) and obeyed (his command). Jabir رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said: 'Ali رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ came with the revenue of the taxes (from Yemen). He (the Holy Prophet) said: For what (purpose) have you entered into the state of Ihram (whether you entered into the state purely for Hajj and, Umra jointly or Hajj and Umra separately)? He said: For the purpose for which the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ) had entered. (The Prophet had entered as a Qiran, i.e. Ihram covering both Umra and Hajj simultaneously.) Thereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: Offer a sacrifice of animal, and retain Ihram. And 'Ali رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ brought a sacrificial animal for him (for the Holy Prophet). Suraqa bin Malik bin Ju'shum رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said: Messenger of Allah, is it (this concession putting off Ihram of Hajj or Umra) meant for this year or is it forever? He said: It is forever.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2944,Jabir bin 'Abdullah (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہما) reported:,"We entered with the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) in the state of Ihram for Hajj. When we came to Mecca he commanded us to put off Ihram and make it for 'Umra. We felt it (the command) hard for us, and our hearts were anguished on account of this and it (this reaction of the people) reached the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). We do not know whether he received (this news) from the Heaven (through revelation) or from the people. (Whatever the case might be) he said; O people, put off Ihram. If there were not the sacrificial animals with me, I would have done as you do. So we put off the Ihram (after performing Umra), and we had intercourse with our wives and did everything which a non-Muhrim does (applying perfume, putting on clothes, etc.), and when It was the day of Tarwiya (8th of Dhu'l-Hijja) we turned our back to Mecca (in order to go to Mini, 'Arafat) and we put on lhram for Hajj.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2945,Musa bin Nafi reported:,"I came to Mecca as a Mutamattil for Umra (performing Umra first and then putting off Ihram and again entering into the state of Ihram for Hajj) four days before the day of Tarwiya (i.e. on the 4th of Dhu'l-Hijja). Thereupon the people said: Now yours is the Hajj of the Meccans. I went to 'Ata' bin Abi Rabah and asked his religious verdict. Ata' said: Jabir bin 'Abdullah al 'Ansari (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ) narrated to me that he performed Hajj with the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) in the year when he took sacrificial animals with him (i.e. during the 10th year of Hijra known as the Farewell Pilgrimage) and they had put on Ihram for Hajj only (as Mufrid). The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: Put off Ihram and circumambulate the House, and (run) between al-Safa and al-Marwa, and get your hair cut and stay as non-Muhrims. When it was the day of Tarwiya, then put on Ihram for Hajj and make lhram for Mut'a (you had put on Ihram for Hajj, but take it off after performing Umra and then again put on Ihram for Hajj). They said: How should we make it Mut'a although we entered upon lhram in the name of Hajj? He said: Do whatever I command you to do. Had I not brought sacrificial animals with me, I would have done as I have commanded you to do. But it is not permissible for me to put off Ihram till the sacrifice is offered. Then they also did accordingly.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2946,Jabir bin 'Abdullah (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہما) reported:,"We set out with Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) as Muhrim for Hajj. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) commanded us to make this Ihram for Umra, and some put it off (after performing 'Umra), but the Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) had sacrificial animals with him, so he could not make it (this Ihram) as that of Umra.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2947,Abu Nadra reported:,"Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ commanded the performance of Mut'a putting ihram for 'Umra during the months of Dhul-Hijja and after completing it. then putting on Ihram for Hajj), but Ibn Zubair رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ forbade to do it. I made a mention of it to Jabir bin Abdullah رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ and he said: It is through me that this hadith has been circulated. We entered into the state of Ihram as Tamattu' with the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). When 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ was Installed as Caliph, he said: Verily Allah made permissible for His Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) whatever He liked and as Re liked. And (every command) of the Holy Qur'an has been revealed for every occasion. So accomplish Hajj and Umra for Allah as Allah has commanded you; and confirm by (proper conditions) the marriage of those women (with whom you have performed Mut'a). And any person would come to me with a marriage of appointed duration (Mut'a), I would stone him (to death).",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2948,Qatada narrated this hadith with the same chain of transmitters saying: (That 'Umar also said):,"Separate your Hajj from 'Umra, for that is the most complete Hajj, and complete your Umra.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2949,Jabir bin 'Abdullah ( رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ) reported:,"We came with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) pronouncing Talbiya for Hajj, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded us to make (our Ihram) into that of Umra.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
