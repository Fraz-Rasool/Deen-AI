Thereupon Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ said: Sad it is what you say! Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) has not been sent, but (to declare in clear words) the lawful and the unlawful (things). We were once with Allah's Messenger (may peace be. upon him) as he was with Maimuna رضی اللہ عنہا , and there were with him al-Fadl bin 'Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ, Khalid bin Walid رضی اللہ عنہ and some women (also) when a tray of food containing flesh was presented to him.

We said to him: Repeat it (your problem) and so he repeated it, but he did not make any reply. (It was repeated thrice ) Then Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) called him out at the third time saying: O man of the desert, verily Allah cursed or showed wrath to a tribe of Bani Isra'il and distorted them to beasts which move on the earth.
