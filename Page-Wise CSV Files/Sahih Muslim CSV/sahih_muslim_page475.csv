4575,"It has been narrated on the authority of Umar رضی اللہ عنہ , who said:","The properties abandoned by Banu Nadir were the ones which Allah bestowed upon His Apostle for which no expedition was undertaken either with cavalry or camelry. These properties were particularly meant for the Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). He would meet the annual expenditure of his family from the income thereof, and would spend what remained for purchasing horses and weapons as preparation for Jihad.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4576,,This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri.,The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4577,It is reported by Zuhri that this tradition was narrated to him by Malik bin Aus who said:,"Umar bin al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ sent for me and I came to him when the day had advanced. I found him in his house sitting on his bare bed-stead, reclining on a leather pillow. He said (to me): Malik, some people of your tribe have hastened to me (with a request for help). I have ordered a little money for them. Take it and distribute it among them. I said: I wish you had ordered somebody else to do this job. He said: Malik, take it (and do what you have been told). At this moment (his man-servant) Yarfa' came in and said: Commander of the Faithful, what do you say about Uthman, Abdul-Rahman bin 'Auf, Zubair and Sa'd رضی اللہ عنہم (who have come to seek an audience with you)? He said: Yes, and permitted them. so they entered. Then he (Yarfa') came again and said: What do you say about 'Ali and Abbas رضی اللہ عنہما (who are present at the door)? He said: Yes, and permitted them to enter. Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ said: Commander of the Faithful, decide (the dispute) between me and this sinful, treacherous, dishonest liar. The people (who were present) also said: Yes. Commander of the Faithful, do decide (the dispute) and have mercy on them. Malik bin Aus said: I could well imagine that they had sent them in advance for this purpose (by 'Ali and Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ). 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said: Wait and be patient. I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heavens and the earth are sustained, don't you know that the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: We (prophets) do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity ? They said: Yes. Then he turned to Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ and 'Ali رضی اللہ عنہ and said: I adjure you both by Allah by Whose order the heavens and earth are sustained, don't you know that the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity ? They (too) said: Yes. (Then) Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said: Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, had done to His Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) a special favor that He has not done to anyone else except him. He quoted the Qur'anic verse: What Allah has bestowed upon His Apostle from (the properties) of the people of township is for Allah and His Messenger . The narrator said: I do not know whether he also recited the previous verse or not. Umar رضی اللہ عنہ continued: The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) distributed among you the properties abandoned by Banu Nadir. By Allah, he never preferred himself over you and never appropriated anything to your exclusion. (After a fair distribution in this way) this property was left over. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) would meet from its income his annual expenditure, and what remained would be deposited in the Bait-ul-Mal. (Continuing further) he said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heavens and the earth are sustained. Do you know this? They said: Yes. Then he adjured Abbas and 'All as he had adjured the other persons and asked: Do you both know this? They said: Yes. He said: When the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) passed away, Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said: I am the successor of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). Both of you came to demand your shares from the property (left behind by the Messenger of Allah). (Referring to Hadrat 'Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ), he said: You demanded your share from the property of your nephew, and he (referring to 'Ali) demanded a share on behalf of his wife from the property of her father. Abu Bakr (رضی اللہ عنہ) said: The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had said: We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity. So both of you thought him to be a liar, sinful, treacherous and dishonest. And Allah knows that he was true, virtuous, well-guided and a follower of truth. When Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ passed away and (I have become) the successor of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and Abu Bakr (رضی اللہ عنہ), you thought me to be a liar, sinful, treacherous and dishonest. And Allah knows that I am true, virtuous, well-guided and a follower of truth. I became the guardian of this property. Then you as well as he came to me. Both of you have come and your purpose is identical. You said: Entrust the property to us. I said: If you wish that I should entrust it to you, it will be on the condition that both of you will undertake to abide by a pledge made with Allah that you will use it in the same way as the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) used it. So both of you got it. He said: Wasn't it like this? They said: Yes. He said: Then you have (again) come to me with the request that I should adjudge between you. No, by Allah. I will not give any other judgment except this until the arrival of the Doomsday. If you are unable to hold the property on this condition, return it to me.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4578,It was narrated that Malik bin Aws bin Hadthan said:,"'Umar bin al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ sent for me and said: Some families from your tribe have come to me (then follows the foregoing hadith) by Malik with the difference that the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) would spend on his family for a year. And sometimes Ma'mar said: He would retain sustenance for his family for a year, and what was left of that he spent in the cause of Allah, the Majestic and Exalted.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4579,It is narrated on the authority of 'A'isha رصی اﷲ عنہا who said:,"When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed away, his wives made up their minds to send 'Uthman bin 'Affan رصی اﷲ عنہ (as their spokesman) to Abu Bakr رصی اﷲ عنہ to demand from him their share from the legacy of the Prophet (ﷺ). (At this), A'isha رصی اﷲ عنہا said to them: Hasn't the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: We (Prophets) do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity?",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4580,It is narrated on the authority of Urwa bin Zubair who narrated from A'isha رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہا :,"She informed him that Fatima رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہا , daughter of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), sent someone to Abu Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ to demand from him her share of the legacy left by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) from what Allah had bestowed upon him at Medina and Fadak and what was left from one-filth of the income (annually received) from Khaibar. Abu Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: We (prophets) do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity. The household of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) will live on the income from these properties, but, by Allah, I will not change the charity of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) from the condition in which it was in his own time. I will do the same with it as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) himself used to do. So Abu Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ refused to hand over anything from it to Fatima who got angry with Abu Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ for this reason. She forsook him and did not talk to him until the end of her life. She lived for six months after the death of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When she died, her husband. 'Ali bin Abu Talib, buried her at night. He did not inform Abu Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ about her death and offered the funeral prayer over her himself. During the lifetime of Fatima, 'All received (special) regard from the people. After she had died, he felt estrangement in the faces of the people towards him. So he sought to make peace with Abu Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ and offer his allegiance to him. He had not yet owed allegiance to him as Caliph during these months. He sent a person to Abu Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ requesting him to visit him unaccompanied by anyone (disapproving the presence of Umar رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ). 'Umar رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ said to Abu Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ: BY Allah, you will not visit them alone. Abu Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ said: What will they do to me? By Allah, I will visit them. And he did pay them a visit alone. 'All recited Tashahhud (as it is done in the beginning of a religious sermon) ; then said: We recognize your moral excellence and what Allah has bestowed upon you. We do not envy the favor (i. e. the Catiphate) which Allah has conferred upon you; but you have done it (assumed the position of Caliph) alone (without consulting us), and we thought we had a right (to be consulted) on account of our kinship with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He continued to talk to Abu Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ (in this vein) until the latter's eyes welled up with tears. Then Abd Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ spoke and said: By Allah, in Whose Hand is my life, the kinship of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is dearer to me than the kinship of my own people. As regards the dispute that has arisen between you and me about these properties, I have not deviated from the right course and I have not given up doing about them what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to do. So 'Ali said to Abu Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ : This aftertnoon is (fixed) for (swearing) allegiance (to you). So when Abu Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ had finished his Zuhr prayer, he ascended the pulpit and recited Tashahhud, and described the status of 'Ali رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ , his delay in swearing allegiance and the excuse which lie had offered to him (for this delay). (After this) he asked for God's forgiveness. Then 'Ali bin Abu Talib recited the Tashahhud. extolled the merits of Abu Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ and (said that) his action was not prompted by any jealousy of Abu Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ on his part or his refusal to accept the high position which Allah had conferred upon him, (adding:) But we were of the opinion that we should have a share in the government, but the matter had been decided without taking us into confidence, and this displeased us. (Hence the delay in offering allegiance. The Muslims were pleased with this (explanation) and they said: You have done the right thing. The Muslims were (again) favorably inclined to 'Ali رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ since he adopted the proper course of action",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4581,It has been narrated on the authority of 'A'isha رضی اﷲ عنہا :,"Fatima رضی اﷲ عنہا and 'Abbas رضی اﷲ عنہ approached Abu Bakr, soliciting transfer of the legacy of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to them. At that time, they were demanding his (Holy Prophet's) lands at Fadak and his share from Khaibar. Abu Bakr رضی اﷲ عنہ said to them: I have heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Then he quoted the hadith having nearly the same meaning as the one which has been narrated by Uqail on the authority of al-Zuhri (and which his gone before) except that in his version he said: Then 'Ali رضی اﷲ عنہ stood up, extolled the merits of Abu Bakr رضی اﷲ عنہ mentioned his superiority, and his earlier acceptance of Islam. Then he walked to Abu Bakr رضی اﷲ عنہ and swore allegiance to him. (At this) people turned towards 'Ali رضی اﷲ عنہ and said: you have done the right thing. And they became favorably inclined to 'Ali after he had adopted the proper course of action.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4582,"'Urwa bin Zubair narrated that 'A'isha رضی اﷲ عنہا , wife of the Prophet (ﷺ), that","Fatima رضی اﷲ عنہا , daughter of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), requested Abu Bakr رضی اﷲ عنہ , after the death of the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him), that he should set apart her share from what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had left from the properties that God had bestowed upon him. Abu Bakr رضی اﷲ عنہ said to her: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is Sadaqa (charity). The narrator said: She (Fatima) lived six months after the death of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and she used to demand from Abu Bakr رضی اﷲ عنہ her share from the legacy of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) from Khaibar, Fadak and his charitable endowments at Medina. Abu Bakr رضی اﷲ عنہ refused to give her this, and said: I am not going to give up doing anything which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to do. I am afraid that it I go against his instructions in any matter I shall deviate from the right course. So far as the charitable endowments at Medina were concerned, 'Umar رضی اﷲ عنہ handed them over to 'Ali رضی اﷲ عنہ and Abbas رضی اﷲ عنہ, but 'Ali got the better of him (and kept the property under his exclusive possession). And as far as Khaibar and Fadak were concerned 'Umar رضی اﷲ عنہ kept them with him, and said: These are the endowments of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (to the Umma). Their income was spent on the discharge of the responsibilities that devolved upon him on the emergencies he had to meet. And their management was to be in the hands of one who managed the affairs (of the Islamic State). The narrator said: They have been managed as such up to this day.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4583,It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira ‌رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ ‌:,The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: My heirs cannot share even a dinar (from my legacy) ; what I leave behind after paving maintenance allowance to my wives and remuneration to my manager is (to go in) charity.,The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih

4588,It has been narrated on the authority of `Umar bin al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ who said:,"When it was the day on which the Battle of Badr was fought, the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) cast a glance at the infidels, and they were one thousand while his own Companions were three hundred and nineteen. The Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) turned (his face) towards the Qibla. Then he stretched his hands and began his supplication to his Lord: O Allah, accomplish for me what Thou hast promised to me. O Allah, bring about what Thou hast promised to me. O Allah, if this small band of Muslims is destroyed. Thou will not be worshipped on this earth. He continued his supplication to his Lord, stretching his hands, facing the Qibla, until his mantle slipped down from his shoulders. So Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ came to him, picked up his mantle and put it on his shoulders. Then he embraced him from behind and said: Prophet of Allah, this prayer of yours to your Lord will suffice you, and He will fulfill for you what He has promised you. So Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, revealed (the Qur'anic verse): When ye appealed to your Lord for help, He responded to your call (saying): I will help you with one thousand angels coming in succession. So Allah helped him with angels. Abu Zumail said that the hadith was narrated to him by Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ who said: While on that day a Muslim was chasing a disbeliever who was going ahead of him, he heard over him the swishing of the whip and the voice of the rider saying: Go ahead, Haizum! He glanced at the polytheist who had (now) fallen down on his back. When he looked at him (carefully he found that) there was a scar on his nose and his face was torn as if it had been lashed with a whip, and had turned green with its poison. An Ansari came to the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and related this (event) to him. He said: You have told the truth. This was the help from the third heaven. The Muslims that day (i.e. the day of the Battle of Badr) killed seventy persons and captured seventy. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said to Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ and `Umar (رضی اللہ عنہ): What is your opinion about these captives? Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said: They are our kith and kin. I think you should release them after getting from them a ransom. This will be a source of strength to us against the infidels. It is quite possible that Allah may guide them to Islam. Then the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم) said: What is your opinion, Ibn Khattab? He said: Messenger of Allah, I do not hold the same opinion as Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ . I am of the opinion that you should hand them over to us so that we may cut off their heads. Hand over `Aqil to `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ that he may cut off his head, and hand over such and such relative to me that I may cut off his head. They are leaders of the disbelievers and veterans among them. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) approved the opinion of Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ and did not approve what I said. The next day when I came to the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌), I found that both he and Abu Bakr were sitting shedding tears. I said: Messenger of Allah, why are you and your Companion shedding tears? Tell me the reason. For I will weep, or I will at least pretend to weep in sympathy with you. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: I weep for what has happened to your companions for taking ransom (from the prisoners). I was shown the torture to which they were subjected. It was brought to me as close as this tree. (He pointed to a tree close to him.) Then God revealed the verse: It is not befitting for a prophet that he should take prisoners until the force of the disbelievers has been crushed... to the end of the verse: so eat ye the spoils of war, (it is) lawful and pure. So Allah made booty lawful for them.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4589,It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ who said:,"The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) sent some horsemen to Najd. They captured a man. He was from the tribe of Banu Hanifa and was called Thumama bin Uthal. He was the chief of the people of Yamama. People bound him with one of the pillars of the mosque. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) came out to (see) him. He said: O Thumama, what do you think? He replied: Muhammad, I have good opinion of you. If you kill me, you will kill a person who has spilt blood. If you do me a favour, you will do a favour to a grateful person. If you want wealth, ask and you will get what you will demand. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be pon him) lefthim (in this condition) for two days, (and came to him again) and said: What do you think, O Thumama? He replied: What I have already told you. If you do a favour, you will do a favour to a grateful person. If you kill me, you will kill a person who has spilt blood. If you want wealth, ask and you will get what you will demand. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) left him until the next day when he (came to him again) and said: What do you think, O Thumama? He replied: What I have already told you. If you do me a favour, you will do a favour to a grateful person. If you kill me, you will kill a person who has spilt blood. If you want wealth ask and you will get what you will demand. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Set Thumama free. He went to a palm-grove near the mosque and took a bath. Then he entered the mosque and said: I bear testimony (to the truth) that there is no god but Allah and I testify that Muhammad is His bondman and His messenger. O Muhammad, by Allah, there was no face on the earth more hateful to me than your face, but (now) your face has become to me the dearest of all faces. By Allah, there was no religion more hateful to me than your religion, but (now) your religion has become the dearest of all religions to me. By Allah, there was no city more hateful to me than your city, but (now) your city has become the dearest of all cities to me. Your horsemen captured me when I intended going for Umra. Now what is your opinion (in the matter)? The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) announced good tidings to him and told him to go on 'Umra. When he reached Mecca, somebody said to him: Have you changed your religion? He said: No! I have rather embraced Islam with the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). By Allah, you will not get a single grain of wheat from Yamama until it is permitted by the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌).",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih

We went out with him until we came to them. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) stood up and called out to them (saying): O ye assembly of Jews, accept Islam (and) you will be safe. They said: Abu'l-Qasim, you have communicated (God's Message to us). The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: I want this (i.e. you should admit that God's Message has been communicated to you), accept Islam and you would be safe. They said: Abu'l-Qisim, you have communicated (Allah's Message). The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: I want this... - He said to them (the same words) the third time (and on getting the same reply) he added: You should know that the earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle, and I wish that I should expel you from this land Those of you who have any property with them should sell it, otherwise they should know that the earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle (and they may have to go away leaving everything behind).",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih

They embraced Islam. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) turned out all the Jews of Medina.

When he approached the mosque, the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said to the Ansar: Stand up to receive your chieftain. Then he said (to Sa'd): These people have surrendered accepting your decision. He (Sa'd) said: You will kill their fighters and capture their women and children. (Hearing this), the Prophet (ﷺ) said: You have adjudged by the command of God. The narrator is reported to have said: Perhaps he said: You have adjuged by the decision of a king.

The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) pitched a tent for him in the mosque and would inquire after him being in close proximity. When he returned from the Ditch and laid down his arms and took a bath, the angel Gabriel appeared to him and he was removing dust from his hair (as if he had just returned from the battle). The latter said: You have laid down arms. By God, we haven't (yet) laid them down. So march against them. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) asked: Where? He pointed to Banu Quraiza. So the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) fought against them. They surrendered at the command of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌), but he referred the decision about them to Sa'd who said: I decide about them that those of them who can fight be killed, their women and children taken prisoners and their properties distributed (among the Muslims).",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
