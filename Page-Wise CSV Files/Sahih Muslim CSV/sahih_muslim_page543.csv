He gave her permission and she said: Allah's Messenger, verily, your wives have sent me to you in order to ask you to observe equity in case of the daughter of Abu Quhafa. She (`A'isha رضی اللہ عنہا) said: I kept quiet. Thereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said to her (Fatima): O daughter, don't you love whom I love? She said: Yes, (I do). Thereupon he said: I love this one. Fatima رضی اللہ عنہا then stood up as she heard this from Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and went to the wives of Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and informed them of what she had said to him and what Allah's messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had said to her. Thereupon they said to her: We think that you have been of no avail to us. You may again go to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and tell him that his wives seek equity in case of the daughter of Abu Quhafa.

She, however, lost temper very soon but was soon calm. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) permitted her to enter as she (`A'isha رضی اللہ عنہا) was along with Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) in her mantle, in the same very state when Fatima رضی اللہ عنہا had entered. She said: Allah's Messenger, your wives have sent me to you seeking equity in case of the daughter of Abu Quhafa. She then came to me and showed harshness to me and I was seeing the eyes of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) whether he would permit me. Zainab went on until I came to know that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) would not disapprove if I retorted. Then I exchanged hot words until I made her quiet.
