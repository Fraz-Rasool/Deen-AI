1560,Abu Huraira ‌رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ ‌reported:,"When the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) returned from the expedition to Khaibar, he travelled one night, and stopped for rest when he became sleepy. He told Bilal to remain on guard during the night and he (Bilal) prayed as much as he could, while the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and his Companions slept. When the time for dawn approached Bilal leaned against his camel facing the direction from which the dawn would appear but he was overcome by sleep while he was leaning against his camel, and neither the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) nor Bilal, nor anyone else among his Companions got up, till the sun shone on them. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) was the first of them to awake and, being startled, he called to Bilal who said: Messenger of Allah I may my father and mother be offered as ransom for thee, the same thing overpowered me which overpowered you. He (the Holy Prophet, then) said: Lead the beasts on: so they led their camels to some distance. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) then performed ablution and gave orders to Bilal who pronounced the Iqama and then led them in the morning prayer. When he finished the prayer he said: When anyone forgets the prayer, he should observe it when he remembers it, for Allah has said: And observe the prayer for remembrance of Me (Qur'an. xx. 14). Yunus said: Ibn Shilab used to recite it like this: (And observe the prayer) for remembrance.",The Book of Mosques and Places of Prayer,Sahih Muslim,2,Sahih
1561,Abu Huraira رضی اﷲ عنہ reported:,We stopped for rest along with the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and did not awake till the sun rose. The Apostle of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) then told us that everybody should take hold of his camel's nosestring (get out of this ground) for it was the place where devil had visited us. We did accordingly. He then called for water and performed ablution and then performed two prostrations. Ya'qub said: Then he prayed (performed) two prostrations. then takbir was pronounced for prayer and then he offered the morning prayer (in congregation).,The Book of Mosques and Places of Prayer,Sahih Muslim,2,Sahih
1562,Abu Qatida رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ ‌reported:,"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) addressed us and said: You would travel In the evening and the might till (God willing) you would come in the morning to a place of water. So the people travelled (self absorbed) without paying any heed to one another, and the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) also travelled till It was midnight. I was by his side. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) began to doze and leaned (to one side) of his camel. I came to him and I lent him support without awaking him till he sat poised on his ride. He went on travelling till a major part of the night was over and (he again) leaned (to one side) of his camel. I supported him without awaking him till he sat bed on his ride. and then travelled till it was near dawn. He (again) leaned which was far more inclined than the two earlier leanings and he was about to fall down. So I came to him and supported him and he lifted his head and said; Who is this? I said: it is Abu Qatida رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ . He (the Prophet again) said: Since how long have you been travelling along with me like this? I said: I have been travelling in this very state since the night. He said: May Allah protect you, as you have protected His Apostle (from falling down), and again said: Do you see that we are hidden from the people? - and again said: Do you see anyone? I said: Here is a rider. I again said: Here Is another rider till we gathered together and we were seven riders. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) stepped aside of the highway and placed his head (for sleep and said): Guard for us our prayers. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) was the first to wake up and the rays of the sun were falling on his back. We got up startled He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) said: Ride on So we rode on till the sun had (sufficiently) risen. He then came down from his camel and called for a jug of water which I had with me. There was a little water in that. He performed ablution with that which was less thorough as compared with his usual ablutions and some water of that had been left. He (the Holy Prophet) said to Abu Qatida رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ : Keep a watch over your jug of water; it would have (a miraculous) condition about it. Then Bilal summoned (people) to prayer and then the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) observed two rak'ahs and then said the morning prayer as he said every day. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) (then) rode on and we rode along with him and some of us whispered to the others saying: How would there be compensation for omission in our prayers? Upon this he (the Messenger of Allah) said: Is there not in me (my life) a model for you? There is no omission in sleeping. The (cognizable) emission is that one should not say prayer (intentionally) till the time of the other prayer comes. So he who did like it (omitted prayer in sleep or due to other unavoidable circumstances) should say prayer when he becomes aware of it and on the next day he should observe it at its prescribed time. He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) said: What do you think the people would have done (at this hour)? They would have in the morning found their Apostle missing from amongst them and then Abu Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ and 'Umar رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ would have told them that the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) must be behind you, he cannot leave you behind (him), but the people said: The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) is ahead of you. So if you had obeyed Abu Bakr and Umar, you would have gone on the right path. So we proceeded on till we came up to the people (from whom we had lagged behind) and the day had considerably risen and everything became hot, and they (the Companions of the Holy Prophet) said: Messenger of Allah, we are dying of thirst. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) remarked: There is no destruction for you. And again said: Bring that small cup of mine and he then asked for the jug of water to be brought to him. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) began to pour water (in that small cup) and Abu Qatida رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ gave them to drink. And when the people saw that there was (a little) water in the jug, they fell upon it. Upon this the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: Behave well; the water (is enough) to satiate all of you. Then they (the Companions) began to receive (their share of) water with calmness (without showing any anxiety) and the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) began to fill (the cap), and I began to serve them till no one was left except me and the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). He then filled (the cup) with water and said to me: Drink it. I said: Messenger of Allah, I would not drink till you drink. Upon this he said: The server of the people Is the last among them to drink. So I drank and the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) also drank and the people came to the place of water quite happy and satiated. 'Abdullah bin Rabah said: I am going to narrate this hadith in the great mosque, when 'Imran bin Husain رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ said: See, O young man, how will you narrate for I was also one of the riders on that night? I said: So you must be knowing this hadith well. He said: Who are you? I said: I am one of the Ansar. Upon this he said: You narrate, for you know your hadith better. I, therefore, narrated it to the people. 'Imran رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ said: I was also present that night, but I know not anyone else who learnt it so well as you have learnt.",The Book of Mosques and Places of Prayer,Sahih Muslim,2,Sahih
1563,Imran bin Husain ‌رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ reported:,"I was with the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) in a journey. We travelled the whole of the night, and when it was about to dawn, we got down for rest, and were overpowered (by sleep) till the sun shone. Abu Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ ‌was the first to awake amongst us. and we did not awake the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) from his sleep allowing him to wake up (of his own accord). It was 'Umar who then woke up. He stood by the side of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and recited takbir in a loud voice till the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) woke up. When he lifted his head, he saw that the sun had arisen; he then said: Proceed on. He travelled along with us till the sun shone brightly. He came down (from his camel) and led us in the morning prayer. A person, however, remained away from the people and did not say, prayer along with us. After having completed the prayer, the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said to him: O, so and so, what prevented you from observing prayer with us? He said: Apostle of Allah! I was not in a state of purity. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ) ordered him arid lie performed Tayammum with dust and said prayer. He then urged me to go ahead immediately along with other riders to find out water, for we felt very thirsty. We were traveling when we came across a woman who was sitting (on a camel) with her feet hanging over two leathern water bags. We said to her: How far is water available? She, said: Far, very far, very far. You cannot get water. We (again) said: How much distance is there between (the residence of) your family and water? She said: It is a day and night journey. We said to her: You go to the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). She said: Who is the Messenger of Allah? We somehow or the other managed to bring her to the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and he asked about her, and she informed him as she had informed us that she was a widow having orphan children. He ordered that her camel should be made to kneal down and he gargled in the opening (of her leathern water-bag). The camel was then raised up and we forty thirsty men drank water till we were completely satiated, and we filled up all leathern water-bags and water-skins that we had with us and we washed our companions, but we did not make any camel drink, and (the leathern water-bags) were about to burst (on account of excess of water). He then said: Bring whatever you have with you. So we collected the bits (of estable things) and dates and packed them up in a bundle, and said to her: Take it away. This is meant for your children, and know that we have not its any way done any loss to your water. W hen she came to her family she said: I have met the greatest magician amongst human beings, or he is an apostle, as he claims to be, and she then narrated what had happened and Allah guided aright those people through that woman. She affirmed her faith in Islam and so did the people embrace Islam.",The Book of Mosques and Places of Prayer,Sahih Muslim,2,Sahih

When the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) got up, the people told him what had happened.
