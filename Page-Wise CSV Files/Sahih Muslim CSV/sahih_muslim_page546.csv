6359,Abdullah bin Samit reported:,"Abu Dharr رضی اللہ عنہ said: We set out from our tribe Ghafir who look upon the prohibited months as permissible months. I and my brother Unais and our mother stayed with our maternal uncle who treated us well. The men of his tribe fell jealous and they said: When you are anay from your house, Unais commits adultery with your wife. Our -naternal uncle came and he accused us of the sin which was conveyed to him. I said: You have undone the good you did to us. We cannot stay with you after this. We came to our camels and loaded (our) luggage. Our maternal uncle began to weep covering himself with (a piece of) cloth. We proceeded on until we encamped by the side of Mecca. Unais cast lot on the camels (we had) and an equal number (above that). They both went to a Kahin and he made Unais win and Unais came with our camels and an equal number along with them. He (Abu Dharr رضی اللہ عنہ) said: My nephew, I used to observe prayer three years before my meeting with Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). I said: For whom did you say prayer? He said: For Allah. I said: To which direction did you turn your face (for observing prayer)? He said: I used to turn my face as Allah has directed me to turn my face. I used to observe the night prayer at the time of the end of night and I fell down in prostration like the mantle until the sun rose over me. Unais said: I have a work in Mecca, so you better stay here. Unais went until he came to Mecca and he came to me late. I said: What did you do? He said: I met a person in Mecca who is on your religion and he claims that verily it is Allah Who has sent him. I said: What do the people say about him? He said: They say that he is a poet or a Kahin or a magician. Unais who was himself one of the poets said. I have heard the words of a Kahin but his words in no way resemble his (words). And 1 also compared his words to the verses of poets but such words cannot be uttered by any poet. By Allah, he is truthful and they are liars. Then I said: you stay here, until I go, so that I should see him. He said: I came to Mecca and I selected an insignificant person from amongst them and said to him: Where is he whom you call as-Sabi? He pointed out towards me saying: He is Sabi. Thereupon the people of the valley attacked me with sods and bows until I fell down unconscious. I stood up after havin. regained my consciousness and I found as if I was a red idol. I came to Zamzarn and washed blood from me and drank water from it and listen, O son of my brother, I stayed there for thirty nights or days and there was no food for me but the water of Zamzarn. And I became so bulky that there appeared wrinkles upon my stomach, and I did not feel any hunger in my stomach. It was during this time that the people of Mecca slept in the moonlit night and none was there to eircumambulate the House but only two women who had been invoking the name of Isafa, and Na'ila (the two idols). They came to me while in their circuit and I said: Marry one with the other, but they did not dissuade from their invoking. They came to me and I said to them: Insert wood (in the idols' private parts). (I said this to them in such plain words) as I could not express in metaphorical terms. These women went away crying and saying: Had there been one amongst our people (he would have taught a lesson to you for the obscene words used for our idols before us). These women met Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ who had also been coming down the hill. He asked them: What has happened to you? They said: There is Sabi, who has hidden himself between the Ka'ba and its curtain. He said: What did he say to you? They said: He uttered such words before us as we cannot express. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) came and he kissed the Black Stone and circumambulated the House along with his Companion and then observed prayer, and when he had finished his prayer, Abu Dharr رضی اللہ عنہ said: I was the first to greet him with the salutation of peace and uttered (these words) in this way; Allah's Messenger, may there be peace upon you, whereupon he said: It may be upon you too and the mercy of Allah. He then said: Who are you? I said: From the tribe of Ghifar. He leaned his hand and placed his finger on his forehead and I said to myself: Perhaps he has not liked it that I belong to the tribe of Ghifar. I attempted to catch hold of his hand but his friend who knew about him more than I dissuaded me f rom doing so. He then lifted his head and said: Since how long have you been here? I said: I have been here for the last thirty nights or days. He said: Who has been feeding you? I said: There has been no food for me but the water of Zamzam. I have grown so bulky that there appear wrinkles upon my stomach and I do not feel any hunger. He said: It is blessed (water) and it also serves as food. Thereupon Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said: Allah's Messenger, let me serve as a host to him for tonight, and then Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) proceeded forth and so did Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ and I went along with them. Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ opened the door and then he brought for us the raisins of Ta'if and that was the first food which I ate there. Then I stayed as long as I had to stay. I then came to Allah's Messenaer ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and he said: I have been shown the land abounding in trees and I think it cannot be but that of Yathrib (that is the old name of Medina). You are a preacher to your people on my behalf. I hope Allah would benefit them through you and He would reward you. I came to Unais and he said: What have you done? I said: I have done that I have embraced Islam and I have testified (to the prophethood of Allah's Messenger). He said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify (to the prophethood of Muhammad). Then both of us came to our mother and she said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify to the prophethood of Muhammad. We then loaded our camels and came to our tribe Ghifir and half of the tribe embraced Islam and their chief was Aimi' bin Rahada Ghifirl and he was their leader and hall of the tribe said: We will embrace Islam when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) would come to Medina, and when Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) came to Medina the remaining half also embraced Islam. Then a tribe Aslam came to the Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and said: Allah's Messenger, we also embrace Islam like our brothers who have embraced Islam. And they also embraced Islam. Thereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Allah granted pardon to the tribe of Ghifar and Allah saved (from destruction) the tribe of Aslam.",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
6360,This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Humaid bin Hilal with the same chain of transmitters but with this addition:,"As I came to Mecca, Unais said: (Well), go but be on your guard against the Meccans for they are his enemies and are annoyed with him.",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
6361,Abdullah bin Samit reported that Abu Dharr رضی اللہ عنہ said:,"Son of my brother, I used to observe prayer two years before the advent of Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). I said: To which direction did you turn your face? He said: To which Allah directed me to turn my face. The rest of the hadith is the same but with this addition that they went to a Kahin and his brother Unais began to praise him until he (in verses declared) him (Unais) as winner (in the contest of poetry), and so we got his camels, mixed them with our camels, and there is in this hadith also these words that Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) came there and he circumambulated the House and observed two Rak'ahs of prayer behind the Station (of Ibrahim). I came to him and I was the first amongst persons to greet him with Assalam-o-'Alaikum, and I said to Allah's Messenger Let there be peace upon you. And he said: Let there be peace upon you too; who are you? And in the hadith (these words are) also found: Since how long have you been here? And Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said: Let him be my guest tonight.",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
6362,Ibn `Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"When Abu Dharr رضی اللہ عنہ heard of the advent of the Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) in Mecca he said: Brother, ride in this valley and bring information for me about the person who claims that there comes to him information from the Heavens. Listen to his words and then come to me. So he rode on until he came to Mecca and he heard his words (the sacred words of the Holy Prophet) and then came back to Abu Dharr رضی اللہ عنہ and said: I have seen him exhorting (people) to develop good morals and his expressions can in no way be termed as poetry. He (Abu Dharr رضی اللہ عنہ ) said: I have not been satisfied with it regarding that which I had in my mind (as I sent you). So he took up provisions for the journey and a small water-skin containing water (and set forth) until he came to Mecca. He came to the mosque (Ka`bah) and began to look for Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and he did not recognize him (the Holy Prophet) and he did not even like that he should ask about him from anyone until it was night, and he slept. `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ saw him and found him to be a stranger. So he went with him. He followed him but one did not make any inquiry from the other about anything until it was morning. He then brought the water and his provisions to the mosque and spent a day there, but he did not see Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) until it was night. He then returned to his bed, and there happened to pass `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ and he said: This man has not been able to find his destination until this time. He made him stand and he went with him and no one made an inquiry from his companion about anything. And when it was the third day he did the same. `Ali رضی اللہ عنہ made him stand up and brought him along with him. He said: By Him, besides Whom there is no god, why don't you tell me (the reason) which brought you here to this town? He said: (I shall do this) provided you hold me promise and a covenant that you would guide me aright. He then did that. He (`Ali رضی اللہ عنہ) said: Verily, he is truthful and he is a Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and when it is morning, follow me and if I would say anything from which I would sense fear about you I would stand (in a manner) as if I was throwing water and if I move on, you then follow me until I get in (some house). He did that and I followed him until he came to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). He entered (the house) of Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) along with him and listened to his words and embraced Islam at this very place. Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said to him: Go to your people and inform them until my command reaches you. Thereupon he said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life, I shall say to the people of Mecca this thing at the top of my voice. So he set forth until he came to the mosque and then spoke at the top of his voice (saying): I bear testimony to the fact that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. The people attacked him and made him fall down when al-`Abbas came and he leaned over him and said: Woe be upon you, don't you know that he is from amongst the tribe of Ghifar and your trading route to Syria passes through (the settlements of this tribe), and he rescued him. He (Abu Dharr رضی اللہ عنہ) did the same on the next day and they (the Meccans) again attacked him and al-`Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ leaned upon him and he rescued him.",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih

So I went along with 150 horsemen and I could not sit with steadfastness upon the horse. I made the mention of it to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and he struck his hand on my chest and said: O Allah, grant him steadfastness and make him the guide of righteousness and the rightly-guided one. So he went away and he set fire to it. Then Jarir رضی اللہ عنہ sent some person to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) whose Kunya was Abu Arta to give him the happy news about that. He came to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and said: I have not come to you (but with the news) that we have left Dhu'l-Khalasah as a scabed camel.
