4086,Abu Nadra reported:,"I asked Ibn Abbas ( رضی اللہ عنہ) about the conversion (of gold and silver for silver and gold). We said: Is it hand to hand exchange? I said: Yes. whereupon he said: There is no harm in it. I informed Abu Sa'id رضی اللہ عنہ about it, telling him that I had asked Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ about it and he said: Is it hand to hand exchange? I said: Yes, whereupon he said: There is no harm in it. He (the narrator) said, or he said like it: We will soon write to him, and he will not give you this fatwa (religious verdict). He said: By Allah, someone of the boy-servants of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) brought dates, but he refused to accept them (on the plea) that those did not seem to be of the dates of our land. He said: Something had happened to the dates of our land, or our dates. So I got these dates (in exchange by giving) excess (of the dates of our land), whereupon he said: You made an addition for getting the fine dates (in exchange) which tantamounts, to interest; don't do that (in future).

I refused to accept it on account of their statement (statement of Ibn 'Abbas and Ibn 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ ). He said: I am not narrating to you except what I heard from Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). There came to him the owner of a date-palm with one sa' of fine dates, and the dates of Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) were of that colour. Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said to him: Where did you get these dates? I went with two sa's of (inferior dates) and bought one sa' of (these fine dates), for that is the prevailing price (of inferior dates) in the market and that is the price (of the fine quality of dates in the market), whereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: Woe be upon you! You have dealt in interest, when you decide to do it (i.e. exchange superior quality of dates for inferior quality); so you should sell your dates for another commodity (or currency) and then with the help of that commodity buy the dates you like. Abu Sa'ad رضی اللہ عنہ said: When dates are exchanged for dates (with different qualities) there is the possibility (of the element of) interest (creeping into that) or when gold is exchanged for gold having different qualities. I subsequently came to Ibn 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ and he forbade me (to do it), but I did not come to Ibn 'Abbas (رضی اللہ عنہ).

I said to him: Ibn 'Abbas (رضی اللہ عنہ) says otherwise, whereupon he said: I met Ibn 'Abbas (رضی اللہ عنہ) and said: Do you see what you say; have you heard it from Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌), or found it in the Book of Allah, the Glorious and Majestic?

Thereupon Ibn Abbas ( رضی اللہ عنہ) said: I don't say that. So far at Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) is concerned, you know him better, and to far as the Book of Allah to concerned, I do not know it (more than you do), but 'Usama bin Zaid ( رضی اللہ عنہ) narrated to me Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) as having said this: Beware, there can be an element of interest in credit.",The Book Of Musaqah,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih

So he who guards against doubtful things keeps his religion and honour blameless, and he who indulges in doubtful things indulges in fact in unlawful things, just as a shepherd who pastures his animals round a preserve will soon pasture them in it. Beware, every king has a preserve, and the things God his declaced unlawful are His preserves. Beware, in the body there is a piece of flesh; if it is sound, the whole body is sound and if it is corrupt the whole body is corrupt, and hearken it is the heart.",The Book Of Musaqah,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih
