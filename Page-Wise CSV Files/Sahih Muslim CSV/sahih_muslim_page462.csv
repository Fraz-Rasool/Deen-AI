4264,Abu Musa رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"My friends sent me to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) asking him to provide them with mounts as they were going along with him in jaish al-'Usrah (the army of destitutes or of meagre means or army setting out during the hard times and that is the occasion of the expedition of Tabuk) I said: Apostle of Allah, my friends have sent me to you so that you may provide them with mounts. He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) said: By Allah, I cannot provide you with anything to ride. And it so happened that he was at that time much perturbed. I little knew of it, so I came back with a heavy heart on account of the refusal of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌), and the fear that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) might have some feelings against me. I returned to my friends and informed them about what Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) had said. I had hardly stayed for a little that I heard Bilal رضی اللہ عنہ calling: 'Abdullah bin Qais. I responded to his call. He said: Hasten to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌), he is calling you, When I came to the Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ) he said: Take this pair, this pair, and this pair (i.e. six camels which he had bought from Sa'd رضی اللہ عنہ), and take them to y, our friends and say: Verily Allah (or he said: Verily Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) has provided you with these animals.

They said to me: By Allah, in our opinion you are certainly truthful, and we would do as you like. So Abu Musa رضی اللہ عنہ went along with some of the men from them until they came to those who had heard the words of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his refusal to (provide) them with (animals) ; and subsequently his granting (the animals) to them; and they narrated to them exactly as Abu Masa رضی اللہ عنہ had narrated to them.",The Book Of Oaths,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih

His complexion was red having the resemblance of a slave. He said to him: Come and (join me in food). He showed reluctance. He (Abu Masa رضی اللہ عنہ) said: Come on, for I saw Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) eating it (fowl's meat), whereupon that person said: I saw it eating something (of filth and rubbish) and I found it repugnant and took an oath that I would never eat that. He (Abu Muds) said: Come, so that I would narrate to you about that (the incident pertaining to vow). (And he narrated thus): I came to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) along with a group of people belonging to the tribe of Ash'ari, asking him to provide us with riding camels. He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) said: By Allah, I cannot provide you with riding animals. And there is nothing with me with which I can provide you a mount. We stayed (for some time) there as Allah willed, and there was brought to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) booty of camels. He called us and commanded that we should be given five white humped camels. As we were about to go back, some of us said to the other: As we made Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) forget oath, there would be no blessing for us (in his gift). We went back to him and said: Allah's Messenger ﷺ, we came to you to provide us with riding animals and you took an oath that you would never equip us with mounts and then you have provided us with the riding beasts Allah's Messenger ﷺ, have you forgotten? Thereupon he said: I swear by Allah that if Allah so wills, I shall not swear an oath, and then consider something else to be better than it without making atonement for my oath and doing the thing that is better. So you go; Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has given you riding animals.",The Book Of Oaths,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih
