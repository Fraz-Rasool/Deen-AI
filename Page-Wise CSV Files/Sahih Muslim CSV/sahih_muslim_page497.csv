5126,Abu Tufail رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"'Ali was asked whether Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) had showed special favour (by disclosing to him) a thing (which he kept secret from others). Thereupon he said: Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) singled us not for (disclosing to us) anything (secret) which he did not make public, (but those few things) which lie in the sheath of my sword. He drew out the written document contained in it and on that (it was mentioned): Allah cursed him who sacrificed for anyone else besides Allah; and Allah cursed him who stole the signposts (demarcating the boundary lines of the) land; and Allah cursed him who cursed his father; and Allah cursed him who accommodated an innovator (in religion).",The Book of Sacrifices,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih

Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) granted me another camel. I made them kneel down one day at the door of an Ansari, and I wanted to carry on them Idhkhir (a kind of grass) in order to sell that. There was with me a goldsmith of the tribe of Qainuqa'. I saught to give a wedding feast (on the occasion of marriage with) Fatima with the help of that (the price accrued from the sale of this grass). And Hamza bin 'Abdul-Muttalib رضی اللہ عنہ was busy in drinking in that house in the company of a singing girl who was singing to him. She said: Hamza رضی اللہ عنہ, get up for slaughtering the fat she-camels. Hamza رضی اللہ عنہ attacked them with the sword and cut off their humps and ripped their haunches, and then took out their livers. I said to Ibn Shihab: Did he take out anything from the hump? He said: He cut off the humps altogether. Ibn Shihab reported 'Ali رضی اللہ عنہ having said: I saw this (horrible) sight and it shocked me, and I came to Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and there was Zaid bin Haritha رضی اللہ عنہ with him and communicated to him this news. He came in the company of Zaid and I also went along with him and he went to Hamza رضی اللہ عنہ and he expressed anger with him. Hamza raised his eyes and said: Are you (not) but the servants of my father? Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) turned back on his heels (on hearing this) until he went away from them.",The Book of Drink,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih

5129,Husain bin 'Ali reported 'Ali having said:,"There fell to my lot a she-camel out of the spoils of war on the Day of Badr, and Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) gave me (another) she-camel on that day out of the Khums (one-fifth reserved for Allah and His Messenger). When I made up my mind to consummate my marriage with Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌), I prevailed upon a goldsmith of the tribe of Qainuqa' to go along with me so that we might bring Idhkhir wishing to sell that to the goldsmiths and thus I should be able to arrange my wedding feast. While I was arranging the equipments. i.e. litters, sacks and ropes, my two she-camels were sitting down at the side of the apartment of a person of the Ansar. I collected (the different articles of equipment) and found to my surprise that their humps had been chopped off and their haunches had been cut off and their livers had been taken out. I could not help weeping when I saw that plight of theirs. I said: Who has done that? They said: Hamza bin 'Abdul-Muttalib has done this. and he is in this house dead drunk in the company of some of the Ansair with asinging girl singing before him and his companions. She said in her song: O Hamza. get up and attack these falty she-camels. Thereupon Hamza stood up with a sword (in his hand) and cut off their humps and ripped their haunches and tore out their livers. 'Ali said: I went away until I came to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and there was with him Zaid bin Haritha. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) recognized from my face what I had experienced, whereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: What has happened to you? I said: Messenger of Allah, by Allah, I have never seen (such an unfortunate day) as this day. Hamza has committed aggression to my she-camels, and has cut off their humps. and ripped their haunches, and he is in a house in the company of some drunkards. (Hearing this) Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) sent for his mantle and, putting it on him, he proceeded, and I and Zaid bin Haritha رضی اللہ عنہ followed him, until he came to the door (of the house) in which there was Hamza رضی اللہ عنہ . He (the Holy Prophet) sought permission which they granted him. and they were all drunk. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) began to reprimand Hamza for what he had done. Hamza's eyes were red. He cast a glance at Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and then looked towards his knees. and then lifted his eyes and cast a glance at his waist and then lifted his eyes and saw his face. And then Hamza said: Are you anything but the slaves of my father? Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) came to know that he was intoxicated, and he thus turned upon his heels, and came out, and we also came out along with him.",The Book of Drink,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
