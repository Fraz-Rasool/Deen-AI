He said: (the people belonging to the tribe of) Ghatafan. I cried thrice: Help! I made the whole city between the two lavas hear my cry. Then I ran straight in their pursuit until I overtook them at Dhu Qarad where they were just going to water their animals. I, being an archer, began to shoot them with my arrows and was saying: I am the son of al-Akwa'. And today is the day when the cowards will meet their doom. I continued to chant until I rescued the milch she-camels from them, and snatched from them thirty mantles. Now, the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and some other people came along. I said: Prophet of Allah, I have prevented them from water while they were thirsty. So you should send a force (to punish them). He (the Holy Prophet) said: Ibn al-Akwa', you have taken (what, you have taken). Now let them go. Then we returned and the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) made me mount behind him on his she-camel until we entered Medina.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih

The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) asked (her): What for are you holding this dagger? She said: I took it up so that I may tear open the belly of a polytheist who comes near me. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) began to smile (at these words). She said: Messenger of Allah, kill all those people-other than us-whom thou hast declared to be free (on the day of the Conquest of Mecca). (They embraced Islam because) they were defeated at your hands (and as such their Islam is not dependable). The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: Umm Sulaim.

My neck is before your neck. The narrator said: I saw `A'isha bint Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہا and Umm Sulaim رضی اللہ عنہا . Both of them had tucked up their garments, so I could see the anklets on their feet. They were carrying water-skins on their backs and would pour water into the mouths of the people.

(On this day), Abu Talha's sword dropped down from his hands twice or thrice because of drowsiness.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4684,It has been narrated on the authority of Yazid bin Hurmuz:,"Najda wrote to Ibn Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ inquiring of him five things. Ibn Abbas said: If I had not the fear of committing (sin) for concealing the knowledge I would not have written to him. Najda wrote to him saying (after praising the Almighty and invoking blessings on the Prophet): Tell me whether the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) took women to participate with him in Jihad; (if he did), whether he allotted them a regular share from the booty; whether he killed the children of (the enemy in the war), how long an orphan would be entitled to consideration as such, and for whom the Khums (fifth part of the booty) was booty. Ibn Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ wrote to him: You have written asking me whether the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) took women with him to participate in Jihad. He did take them to the battle and sometimes he fought along with them. They would treat the wounded and were given a reward from the booty, but he did not assign any regular share for them. And the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) did not kill the children of the enemy, so you should not kill the children. Also you have written to me asking me when the orphanhood of an orphan comes to an end. By my life, if a man has become bearded but is still incapable of getting his due from others or fulfilling his obligation towards them, (he is yet an orphan to be treated as such), but when he can look after his interests like grown-up people, he is no longer an orphan. And you have written to me inquiring about Khums as to whom it is meant for. (In this connection) we (the kinsmen of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ) used to say: It is for us, but those people (i.e. Banu Umayya) have denied it to us.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4685,It was narrated from Yazid bin Hurmuz said:,"""Najd wrote to Ibn Abbas and asked him about some things... A hadith like that of Sulaiman bin bilal (no. 4684), except that in the hadith of Hatim it says: The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) used not to kill the children, so thou shouldst not kill them unless you could know what Khadir had known about the child he killed, or you could distinguish between a child who would grow up to he a believer (and a child who would grow up to be a non-believer), so that you killed the (prospective) non-believer and left the (prospective) believer aside.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4686,It has been narrated on the authority of Yazid bin Hurmuz who said:,"Najda bin 'Amir al-Haruri wrote to Ibn Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ asking him about the slave and the woman as to whether they would get a share from the booty (it they participated in Jihad) ; about the killing of (enemy) children (in war) ; about the orphan as to when his orphanhood comes to an end; about kinsmen (of the Holy Prophet) as to who they are. He said to Yazid: Write to him. (If he were not likely to fall into folly, I would not have written to him.) Write: You have written asking about the woman and the slave whether they would get a share of the booty if they participated in Jihad. (You should know that) there is nothing of the sort for them except that they will be given a prize. And you have written asking me about the killing of the enemy children in war. (You should understand that) the Messenger of Allah (may peare be upon him) did not kill them. and thou shouldst not kill them unless thou knew what the companion of Moses (i. e. Khadir) knew about the boy he had killed. And you have written asking me about the orphan as to when the period of his orphanhood comes to an end, so that the sobriquet of orphan is dropped from him. (In this regard, you should know that) the sobriquet orphan will not be dropped from him until he attains maturity of body and mind. And you have written asking me about the close relatives (of the Holy Prophet) as to who they are. We think that it is we, but our people have denied us this (position and its concomitant privileges).",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih

I was sitting in the company of Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ when he read his letter and wrote its reply. Ibn Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ said: Were it not for preventing him from falling into wickedness. I would not have replied to his letter, may he never be joyful. He wrote in reply to him referring to the share of the close relatives (of the Holy Prophet) (from the booty) whom God has mentioned. (I have to tell you that) we thought we were the close relatives of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌), but our people have refused to recognize us as such. You have asked about the orphan as to when his orphanhood comes to an end. (I have to say that) when he reaches the age of marriage, attains maturity of mind, and his property is returned to him, then he is no longer an orphan. You have inquired whether the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upo him) used to kill anyone from the children of the polytheists in the war. (You should know that) the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) used not to kill any one of their children, and you (too) should not kill any one of them, except when you knew about them what Khadir had known about the boy whom he killed. And you have inquired whether there is a fixed share of the booty for women and slaves when they participate in a battle. (I have to tell you that) there is no fixed share for them except that they will be given some reward from the spoils of war.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
