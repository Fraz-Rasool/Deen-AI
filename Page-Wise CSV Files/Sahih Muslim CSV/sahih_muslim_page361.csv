1739,Sa'd bin Hisham bin 'Amir reported:,"He decided to participate in the expedition for the sake of Allah, so he came to Medina and he decided to dispose of his property there and buy arms and horses instead and fight against the Romans to the end of his life. When he came to Medina, he met the people of Medina. They dissuaded him to do such a thing, and informed him that a group of six men had decided to do so during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) forbade them to do it, and said: Is there not for you a model pattern in me? And when they narrated this to him (Sa'd bin Hisham), he returned to his wife, though he had divorced her and made (people) witness to his reconciliation. He then came to Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ and asked him about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ said: Should I not lead you to one who knows best amongst the people of the world about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌)? He said: Who is it? He (Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ) said: It is 'A'isha رضی اللہ عنہا . So go to her and ask her (about Witr) and then come to me and inform me about her answer that she would give you. So I came to Hakim bin Aflah and requested him to take me to her. He said: I would not go to her, for I forbade her to speak anything (about the conflict) between the two groupS, but she refused (to accept my advice) and went (to participate in that corflict). I (requested) him (Hakim) with an oath to lead me to her. So we went to 'A'isha رضی اللہ عنہا and we begged permission to meet her. She granted us permission and we went in. She said: Are you Hakim? (She recognised him.) He replied: Yes. She said: Who is there with you? He said: He is Sa'd bin Hisham. She said: Which Hisham? He said: He is Hisham bin 'Amir. She blessed him ('Amir) with mercy from Allah and spoke good of him (Qatada said that he died as a martyr in Uhud). I said: Mother of the Faithful, tell me about the character of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). She said: Don't you read the Qur'an? I said: Yes. Upon this she said: The character of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) was the Qur'an. He said: I felt inclined to get up and not ask anything (further) till death. But then I changed my mind and said: Inform me about the observance (of the night prayer) of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). She said: Did you not recite: O thou wrapped up ? He said: Yes. She said: Allah, the Exalted and the Glorious, made the observance of the night prayer at the beginning of this Surah obligatory. So the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him and his Companions around him observed this (night prayer) for one year. Allah held back the concluding portion of this Surah for twelve months in the Heaven till (at the end of this period) Allah revealed the concluding verses of this Surah which lightened (the burden of this prayer), and the night prayer became a supererogatory prayer after being an obligatory one. I said: Mother of the Faithful, inform me about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). She said: I used to prepare tooth stick for him and water for his ablution, and Allah would rouse him to the extent He wished during the night. He would use the tooth stick, and perform ablution, and would offer nine rak'ahs, and would not sit but in the eighth one and would remember Allah, and praise Him and supplicate Him, then he would get up without uttering the salutation and pray the ninth rak'ah. He would then sit, remember, praise Him and supplicate Him and then utter a salutation loud enough for us to hear. He would then pray two rak'ahs sitting after uttering the salutation, and that made eleven rak'ahs. O my son, but when the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) grew old and put on flesh, he observed Witr of seven, doing in the two rak'ahs as he had done formerly, and that made nine. O my son, and when the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ) observed prayer, he liked to keep on observing it, and when sleep or pain overpowered him and made it impossible (for him) to observe prayer in the night, he prayed twelve rak'ahs daring the day. I am not aware of Allah's Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) having recited the whole Qur'an during one single night, or praying through the night till morning, or fasting a complete month, except Ramadan. He (the narrator) said: I then went to Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ and narrated to him the hadith (transmitted from her), and he said: She says the truth If I went to her and got into her presence, I would have listened to it orally from her. He said: If I were to know that you do not go to her. I would not have transmitted this hadith to you narrated by her.",The Book of Prayer - Travellers,Sahih Muslim,2,Sahih
