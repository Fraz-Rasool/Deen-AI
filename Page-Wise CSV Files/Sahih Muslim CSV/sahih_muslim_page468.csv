They said: Who dare it, but Usama رضی اللہ عنہ , the loved one of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ )? So Usama رضی اللہ عنہ spoke to him. Thereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Do you intercede regarding one of the punishments prescribed by Allah? He then stood up and addressed (people) saying: O people, those who have gone before you were destroyed, because if any one of high rank committed theft amongst them, they spared him; and it anyone of low rank committed theft, they inflicted the prescribed punishment upon him. By Allah, if Fatima, daughter of Muhammad, were to steal, I would have her hand cut off. In the hadith transmitted on the authority of Ibn Rumh (the words are): Verily those before you perished.",The Book Of Legal Punishments,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih
4411,"`A'isha, the wife of Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ), reported:","The Quraish were concerned about the woman who had committed theft during the lifetime of Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌), in the expedition of Victory (of Mecca). They said: Who would speak to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) about her? They (again) said: Who can dare do this but Usama bin Zaid رضی اللہ عنہ, the loved one of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌)? She was brought to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and Usama bin Zaid رضی اللہ عنہ spoke about her to him (interceded on her behalf). The color of the face of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) changed, and he said: Do you intercede in one of the prescribed punishments of Allah? He (Usama رضی اللہ عنہ) said: 'Messenger of Allah, seek forgiveness for me.' When it was dusk. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) stood up and gave an address. He (first) glorified Allah as He deserves, and then said: Now to our topic. This (injustice) destroyed those before you that when any one of (high) rank committed theft among them, they spared him, and when any weak one among them committed theft, they inflicted the prescribed punishment upon him. By Him in Whose Hand is my life, even if Fatima daughter of Muhammad were to commit theft, I would have cut off her hand. He (the Holy Prophet) then commanded about that woman who had committed theft, and her hand was cut off. `A'isha رضی اللہ عنہا (further) said: Hers was a good repentance, and she later on married and used to come to me after that, and I conveyed her needs (and problems) to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ).",The Book Of Legal Punishments,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih

And thus her hand was cut off.",The Book Of Legal Punishments,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih
4414,Ubada bin as-Samit رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) as saying: Receive (teaching) from me, receive (teaching) from me.

Verily Allah has ordained a way for them (the women who commit fornication),: (When) a married man (commits adultery) with a married woman, and an unmarried male with an unmarried woman, then in case of married (persons) there is (a punishment) of one hundred lashes and then stoning (to death). And in case of unmarried persons, (the punishment) is one hundred lashes and exile for one year.",The Book Of Legal Punishments,Sahih Muslim,4,sahih

4418,Abdullah bin 'Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"'Umar bin Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ sat on the pulpit of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and said: Verily Allah sent Muhammad ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) with truth and He sent down the Book upon him, and the verse of stoning was included in what was sent down to him. We recited it, retained it in our memory and understood it. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) awarded the punishment of stoning to death (to the married adulterer and adulteress) and, after him, we also awarded the punishment of stoning, I am afraid that with the lapse of time, the people (may forget it) and may say: We do not find the punishment of stoning in the Book of Allah, and thus go astray by abandoning this duty prescribed by Allah. Stoning is a duty laid down in Allah's Book for married men and women who commit adultery when proof is established, or it there is pregnancy, or a confession.",The Book Of Legal Punishments,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih

He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) turned away until he did that four times, and as he testified four times against his own self, Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) called him and said: Are you mad? He said: No. He (again) said: Are you married? He said: Yes. Thereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Take him and stone him. Ibn Shihab (one of the narrators) said: One who had heard Jabir bin 'Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہ saying this informed me thus: I was one of those who stoned him.

He bore witness against his own self four times that he had committed adultery, whereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Perhaps (you kissed her or embraced her). He said: No. by God, one deviating (from the path of virtue) has committed adultery. He then got him stoned (to death), and then delivered the address: Behold, as we set out for Jihad in the cause of Allah, one of you lagged behind and shrieked like the bleating of a male goat, and gave a small quantity of milk. By Allah, in case I get hold of him, I shall certainly punish him.",The Book Of Legal Punishments,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih
