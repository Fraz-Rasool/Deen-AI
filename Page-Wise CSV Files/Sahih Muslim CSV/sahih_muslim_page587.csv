7378,Mughira bin Shu'ba رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"No one asked Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) more about Dajjil than I asked him. He said: He should not be a source of worry to you for he would not be able to do any harm to you. I said: Allah's Messenger, it is alleged that he would have along with him (abundance of) food and water. Thereupon he said: He would be very insignificant in the eye of Allah (even) with all this.",The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7379,Mughira bin Shu'ba رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,None asked Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) about Dajjal more than I asked him. I (one of the narrators other than Mughira bin Shu'ba) said: What did you ask? Mughira replied: I said that the people alleged that he would have a mountain load of bread and mutton and rivers of water. Thereupon he said: He would be more insignificant in the eye of Allah compared with all this.,The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih

7381,Abdullah bin 'Amr رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"A person came to him and said: What is this hadith that you narrate that the Last Hour would come at such and such time? Thereupon he said: Hallowed be Allah, there is no god but Allah (or the words to the same effect). I have decided that I would not narrate anything to anyone now. I had only said that you would see after some time an important event that the (sacred) House (Ka'ba) would be burnt and it would happen and definitely happen. He then reported that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: The Dajjal would appear in my Ummah and he would stay (in the world) for forty - I cannot say whether he meant forty days, forty months or forty years. And Allah would then send Jesus son of Mary who would resemble 'Urwa bin Mas'ud رضی اللہ عنہ . He (Jesus Christ) would chase him and kill him. Then people would live for seven years that there would be no rancour between two persons. Then Allah would send cold wind from the side of Syria that none would survive upon the earth having a speck of good in him or faith in him but he would die, so much so that even if some amongst you were to enter the innermost part of the mountain, this wind would reach that place also and that would cause his death. I heard Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) as saying: Only the wicked people would survive and they would be as careless as birds with the characteristics of beasts. They would never appreciate the good nor condemn evil. Then Satan would come to them in human form and would say: Don't you respond? And they would say: What do you order us? And he would command them to worship the idols but, in spite of this, they would have abundance of sustenance and lead comfortable lives. Then the trumpet would be blown and no one would hear that but he would bend his neck to one side and raise it from the other side and the first one to hear that trumpet would be the person who would be busy in setting right the tank meant for providing water to the camels. He would swoon and the other people would also swoon, then Allah would send or He would cause to send rain which would be like dew and there would grow out of it the bodies of the people. Then the second trumpet would be blown and they would stand up and begin to look (around). Then it would be said: O people, go to your Lord, and make them stand there. And they would be questioned. Then it would be said: Bring out a group (out of them) for the Hell-Fire. And then it would be asked: How much? It would be said: Nine hundred and ninty-nine out of one thousand for the Hell-Fire and that would be the day which would make the children old because of its terror and that would be the day about which it has been said: On the day when the shank would be uncovered (lxviii. 42).",The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7382,Ya'qub bin 'Asim bin Urwa bin Mas'ud reported:,"I heard a person saying to 'Abdullah bin Amr رضی اللہ عنہ : You say that the Last Hour would come at such and such time, whereupon he said: I had made up my mind that I would not narrate anything to you. I only said: But you would soon see after some time a very significant affair, for example the burning of the House (Ka'ba). Shu'ba said like this and 'Abdullah bin Amr رضی اللہ عنہ reported Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) having said: The Dajjal would appear in my Ummah. And in another hadith (the words are): None would survive who would have even a speck of faith in his heart, but he would be dead. Muhammad bin Ja'far رضی اللہ عنہ reported that Shu'ba narrated to him this hadith many a time and I also read it out to him many a time.",The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7383,`Abdullah bin `Amr رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"I committed to memory a hadith from Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and I did not forget it after I had heard Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) as saying: The first sign (out of the signs of the appearance of the Dajjal) would be the appearance of the sun from the west, the appearance of the beast before the people in the forenoon and which of the two happens first, the second one would follow immediately after that.",The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7384,Abu Zur'a reported:,"Three persons amongst Muslims had been sitting in Medina in the presence of Marwan bin Hakam and they heard him narrate these signs from him and the first amongst them was the appearance of the Dajjal. 'Abdullah bin 'Amr رضی اللہ عنہ reported that Marwin said nothing (particular in this connection). I, however, heard a hadith from Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and I did not forget that after I had heard that from Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and he reported a hadith like the foregoing.",The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7385,Abu Zur'a reported:,"There was a discussion in the presence of Marwan about the Last Hour, and Abdullah bin 'Amr رضی اللہ عنہ said: I heard Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) as saying. The rest of the hadith is the same, but there is no mention of forenoon.",The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7386,Amir bin Sharahil Sha'bi Sha'b Hamdan reported:,"He asked Fatima رضی اللہ عنہ , daughter of Qais and sister of ad-Dahhak bin Qais رضی اللہ عنہ and she was the first amongst the emigrant women: Narrate to me a hadith which you had heard directly from Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and there is no extra link in between them. She said: Very well, if you like, I am prepared to do that, and he said to her: Well, do It and narrate that to me. She said: I married the son of Mughira and he was a chosen young man of Quraish at that time, but he fell as a martyr in the first Jihad (fighting) on the side of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). When I became a widow, 'Abdul-Rahman bin Auf, one amongst the group of the Companions of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌), sent me the proposal of marriage. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) also sent me such a message for his freed slave Usama bin Zaid رضی اللہ عنہ . And it had been conveyed to me that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had said (about Usama): He who loves me should also love Usama. When Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) talked to me (about this matter), I said: My affairs are in your hand. You may marry me to anyone whom you like. He said: You better shift now to the house of Umm Sharik, and Umm Sharik was a rich lady from amongst the Ansar. She spent generously for the cause of Allah and entertained guests very hospitably. I said: Well, I will do as you like. He said: Do not do that for Umm Sharik is a woman who is very frequently visited by guests and I do not like that your head may be uncovered or the cloth may be removed from your shank and the strangers may catch sight of them which you abhor. You better shift to the house of your cousin 'Abdullah bin 'Amr bin Umm Maktum and he is a person of the Bani Fihr branch of the Quraish, and he belonged to that tribe (to which Fatima رضی اللہ عنہا ) belonged. So I shifted to that house, and when my period of waiting was over, I heard the voice of an announcer making an announcement that the prayer would be observed in the mosque (where) congregational prayer (is observed). So I set out towards that mosque and observed prayer along with Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and I was in the row of the women which was near the row of men. When Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had finished his prayer, he sat on the pulpit smiling and said: Every worshipper should keep sitting at his place. He then said: Do you know why I had asked you to assemble? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: By Allah. I have not made you assemble for exhortation or for a warning, but I have detained you here, for Tamim Dari, a Christian, who came and accepted Islam, told me something, which agrees with what I was telling, you about the Dajjal. He narrated to me that he had sailed in a ship along with thirty men of Bani Lakhm and Bani Judham and had been tossed by waves in the ocean for a month. Then these (waves) took them (near) the land within the ocean (island) at the time of sunset. They sat in a small side-boat and entered that island. There was a beast with long thick hair (and because of these) they could not distinguish his face from his back. They said: Woe to you, who can you be? Thereupon it said: I am al-Jassasa. They said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: O people, go to this person in the monastery as he is very much eager to know about you. He (the narrator) said: When it named a person for us we were afraid of it lest it should be a devil. Then we hurriedly went on till we came to that monastery and found a well-built person there with his hands tied to his neck and having iron shackles between his two legs up to the ankles. We said: Woe be upon thee, who are you? And he said: You would soon come to know about me. but tell me who are you. We said: We are people from Arabia and we embarked upon a boat but the sea-waves had been driving us for one month and they brought as near this island. We got Into the side-boats and entered this island and here a beast met us with profusely thick hair and because of the thickness of his hair his face could not be distinguished from his back. We said: Woe be to thee, who are you? It said: I am al-Jassasa. We said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: You go to this very person in the monastery for he is eagerly waiting for you to know about you. So we came to you in hot haste fearing that that might be the Devil. He (that chained person) said: Tell me about the date-palm trees of Baisan. We said: About what aspect of theirs do you seek information? He said: I ask you whether these trees bear fruit or not. We said: yes. Thereupon he said: I think these would not bear fruits. He said: Inform me about the lake of Tabariyya? We said: Which aspect of it do you want to know? He said: Is there water in it? They said: There is abundance of water in it. Thereupon he said: I think it would soon become dry. He again said: Inform me about the spring of Zughar. They said: Which aspect of it you want to know? He (the chained person) said: Is there water in it and does it irrigate (the land)? We said to him: Yes, there is abundance of water in it and the inhabitants (of Medina) irrigate (land) with the help of it, He said: Inform me about the unlettered Prophet; what has he done? We said: He has come out from Mecca and has settled In Yathrib (Medina). He said: Do the Arabs fight against him? We said: Yes. He said: How did he deal with them? We informed him that he had overcome those in his neighbourhood and they had submitted themselves before him. Thereupon he said to us: Has it actually happened? We said: Yes. Thereupon he said: If it is so that is better for them that they should show obedience to him. I am going to tell you about myself and I am Dajjal and would be soon permitted to get out and so I shall get out and travel in the land, and will not spare any town where I would not stay for forty nights except Mecca and Medina as these two (places) are prohibited (areas) for me and I would not make an attempt to enter any one of these two. An angel with a sword in his hand would confront me and would bar my way and there would be angels to guard every passage leading to it; then Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) striking the pulpit with the help of the end of his staff said: This implies Taiba meaning Medina. Have I not, told you an account (of the Dajjal) like this? 'The people said: Yes, and this account narrated by Tamim Dari was liked by me for it corroborates the account which I gave to you in regard to him (Dajjal) at Medina and Mecca. Behold he (Dajjal) is in the Syrian sea (Mediterranean) or the Yemen sea (Arabian sea). Nay, on the contrary, he is in the east, he is in the east, he is in the east, and he pointed with his hand towards the east. I (Fatima bint Qais رضی اللہ عنہا ) said: I preserved it in my mind (this narration from Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ).",The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7387,Al-Sha'bi reported:,"We visited Fatima bin Qais رضی اللہ عنہ and she served us fresh dates which are called rutab and she also served us barley. I asked her about that woman in whose case three divorces had been pronounced as to how much time she should count as the waiting period. She said: My husband pronounced three divorces in my case and Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) permitted me to spend any waiting period in my family. (It was during this period) that announcement was made for the people to observe prayer in the bigger Mosque. I went there along with people and I was in the front row meant for women and it was adjacent to the last row of men and I heard Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) deliver sermon sitting on the pulpit. He said: The cousin of Tamim (Dari) sailed in the ocean. The rest of the hadith is the same but with this addition: (I see) as if I am looking to Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) pointing his rod towards the land (and saying): It is Taiba, i.e. Medina.",The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih

They moved about in that land in search of water. There they saw a person who had been pulling his hair. The rest of the hadith is the same. And he (Dajjal) said: If I were to be permitted to set out I would have covered all the lands except Taiba.
