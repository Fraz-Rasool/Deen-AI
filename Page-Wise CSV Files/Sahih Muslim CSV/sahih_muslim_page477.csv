Then they laughed at him and some of them leaned upon the others with laughter. And I stood looking. If I had the power, I would have thrown it away from the back of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). The Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had bent down his head in prostration and did not raise it, until a man went (to his house) and informed (his daughter) Fatima رضی اللہ عنہا, who was a young girl (at that time) (about this ugly incident).
