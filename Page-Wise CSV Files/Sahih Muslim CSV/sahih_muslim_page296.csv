We heard the humming of his voice but could not fully discern what he had been saying, till he came nigh to the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). It was then (disclosed to us) that he was asking questions pertaining to Islam. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Five prayers during the day and the night. (Upon this he said: Am I obliged to say any other (prayer) besides these? He (the Holy Prophet, ) said: No, but whatever you observe voluntarily, out of your own free will, and the fasts of Ramadan. The inquirer said: Am I obliged to do anything else besides this? He (the Holy Prophet) said: No, but whatever you do out of your own free will. And the Messenger of Allah told him about the Zakat (poor-rate). The inquirer said: Am I obliged to pay anything else besides this? He (the Holy Prophet) said: No, but whatever you pay voluntarily out of your own free will.

102,It is reported on the authority of Anas bin Malik ‌رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ that he said:,"We were forbidden that we should ask anything (without the genuine need) from the Holy Prophet ﷺ.

A man from the dwellers of the desert came (to the Holy Prophet ﷺ) and said: Muhammad, your messenger came to us and told us your assertion that verily Allah had sent you (as a prophet ﷺ). He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) remarked: He told the truth. He (the bedouin) said: Who created the heaven? He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) replied: Allah. He (the bedouin again) said: Who created the earth? He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) replied: Allah. He (the bedouin again) said: Who raised these mountains and who created in them whatever is created there? He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) replied: Allah. Upon this he (the bedouin) remarked: By Him Who created the heaven and created the earth and raised mountains thereupon, has Allah (in fact) sent you? He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) said: Yes. He (the bedouin) said: Your messenger also told us that five prayers (had been made) obligatory for us during the day and the night. He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) remarked: He told you the truth.

He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) addressing the bedouin said: (Repeat) whatever you have uttered. He (the bedouin) repeated that. Upon this the Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) remarked: The deed which can draw you near to Paradise and take you away from Hell is, that you worship Allah and associate none with Him, and you establish prayer and pay Zakat, and do good to your kin.

They (the members of the delegation) said: Messenger of Allah, we come to you from a far-off distance and there lives between you and us a tribe of the unbelievers of Mudar and, therefore, it is not possible for us to come to you except in the sacred months. Thus direct us to a clear command, about which we should inform people beside us and by which we may enter heaven. He (the Holy Prophet) replied: I command you to do four deeds and forbid you to do four (acts), and added: I direct you to affirm belief in Allah alone, and then asked them: Do you know what belief in Allah really implies? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. The Prophet said: It implies testimony to the fact that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, establishment of prayer, payment of Zakat, fast of Ramadan, that you pay one-fifth of the booty (fallen to your lot) and I forbid you to use gourd, wine jar, or a receptacle for wine.

Upon this the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: I enjoin upon you four (things) and forbid you to do four (things): worship Allah and associate none with Him, establish prayer, pay Zakat, and observe the fast of Ramadan, and pay the fifth part out of the booty. And I prohibit you from four (things): dry gourds, green-coloured jars, hollowed stumps of palm-trees, and receptacles. They (the members of the delegation) said: Do you know what al-naqir is? He replied: Yes, it is a stump which you hollow out and in which you throw small dates. Sa'id said: He (the Holy Prophet) used the word tamar (dates). (The Prophet then added): Then you sprinkle water over it and when its ebullition subsides, you drink it (and you are so intoxicated) that one amongst you, or one amongst them (the other members of your tribe, who were not present there) strikes his cousin with the sword. He (the narrator) said: There was a man amongst us who had sustained injury on this very account due to (intoxication), and he told that he tried to conceal it out of shame from the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). I, however, inquired from the Messenger of Allah (it we discard those utensils which you have forbidden us to use), then what type of vessels should be used for drink? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: In the waterskin the mouths of which are tied (with a string). They (again) said: Prophet of Allah, our land abounds in rats and water-skins cannot remain preserved. The holy Prophet of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: (Drink in water-skins) even if these arenibbled by rats. And then (addressing) al-Ashajj of 'Abdul-Qais he said: Verily, you possess two such qualities which Allah loves: insight and deliberateness.",The Book of Faith,Sahih Muslim,1,Sahih

He (the Prophet) said: (Not to speak of beverages, I would lay stress) that you should not drink in the wine jars. They said: Apostle of Allah, may God enable us to lay down our lives for you, do you know what al-naqir is? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Yes, it is a stump which you hollow out in the middle, and added: Do not use gourd or receptacle (for drink). Use water-skin the mouth of which is tied with a thong (for this purpose).",The Book of Faith,Sahih Muslim,1,Sahih

Beware of the supplication of the oppressed for there is no barrier between him and Allah.",The Book of Faith,Sahih Muslim,1,Sahih

123,,"It is narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that when the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) sent Mu'adh towards Yemen (as governor) he said to him: Verily you would reach a community of the people of the Book, the very first thing to which you should call them is the worship of Allah, may His Glory be Magnificent, and when they become fully aware of Allah, instruct them that He has enjoined five prayers on them during the day and the night, and when they begin observing it, then instruct them that verily Allah has made Zakat obligatory for them which would be collected from the wealthy amongst them and distributed to their needy ones, and when they submit to it, then collect it from them and avoid (the temptation) of selecting the best (items) of their riches.",The Book of Faith,Sahih Muslim,1,Sahih
124,It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ :,"When the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) breathed his last and Abu Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ was appointed as his successor (Caliph), those amongst the Arabs who wanted to become apostates became apostates. 'Umar bin Khattab رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ said to Abu Bakrرضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ: Why would you fight against the people, when the Messenger of Allah declared: I have been directed to fight against people so long as they do not say: There is no god but Allah, and he who professed it was granted full protection of his property and life on my behalf except for a right? His (other) affairs rest with Allah. Upon this Abu Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ said: By Allah, I would definitely fight against him who severed prayer from Zakat, for it is the obligation upon the rich. By Allah, I would fight against them even to secure the cord (used for hobbling the feet of a camel) which they used to give to the Messenger of Allah (as zakat) but now they have withheld it. Umar bin Khattab رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ remarked: By Allah, I found nothing but the fact that Allah had opened the heart of Abu Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ for (perceiving the justification of) fighting (against those who refused to pay Zakat) and I fully recognized that the (stand of Abu Bakr رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ) was right.",The Book of Faith,Sahih Muslim,1,Sahih
