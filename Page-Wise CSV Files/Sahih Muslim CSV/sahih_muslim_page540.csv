Then still another man asked for the door to be opened, and thereupon Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Open it and give him the glad tidings of Paradise after a trial would afflict him. I went and, saw, it was 'Uthman bjn 'Affan رضی اللہ عنہ. I opened the door and gave him the glad tidings of Paradise and informed him (what the Prophet had said).

6214,Abu Musa Ash'ari رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"He performed ablution in his house and then came out saying: I would remain with Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) the whole day long. He came to the mosque, and asked about Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). They (his Companions) said: He has gone in this direction. He (Abu Musa Ash'ari) said: I followed his steps asking about him until I came to Bi'r Aris (it is a well in the suburb of Medina). I sat by its wooden door until Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had relieved himself and then performed ablution. I went to him and he was sitting with his shanks uncovered hp to the knees and his legs dangl- ing in that well. I offered him salutations. I then came back and sat at the door as if I had been a chamberlain at the door of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) that day. There came Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ and knocked the door and I said: Who is it? He said: This is Abu Bakr. I said: Wait, please. I went and said: Allah's Messenger, here is Abu Bakr seeking permission. Thereupon he said: Admit him and give him glad tidings of Paradise. I came and I said to Abu Bakr to get in (and also told him) that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) was giving him the glad tidings of Paradise. Abu Bakr got in and sat on the right side of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and dangled his feet in the well as Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had done, and he uncovered his shanks. I then returned and sat there and I had left my brother as he had been performing ablution and he was to meet me and I said: If Allah would intend goodness for such and such he would intend goodness for his brother and He would bring him. I was thinking this that a person stirred the door. I said: Who is it. He said: This is Umar bin Khattab. I said: Wait. Then I came to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ), greeted him and said: Here is 'Umar seeking your. permission to get in. Thereupon he said: Let him come in and give him glad tid- ings of Paradise. I came to Umar and said: There is permission for you and glad tidings for you from Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) for Paradise. He got in and sat on the left side of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) with his feet dangling in the well. I then returned and sat and said: If Allah would intend goodness for such and such (that is for his brother), He would bring him. And I was contemplat- ing over it that a man stirred the door and I said: Who is it? He said: This is Uthman bin Affan. I said: Wait, please. I then came to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and informed him. and he said: Admit him and give him glad tidings (and inform) him of the turmoil which he shall have to face. I came and said: Get in, Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) gives you the glad tidings of Paradise along with the trial which you shall have to face. He got in and saw the elevated plan round the well fully occupied. He sat on the other side. Sharik said that Sa'id bin al-Musayyib reported: I drew a conclusion from it that their groves would be (in this very state, the graves of Hadrat Abu Bakr, 'Umar Faruq by the tide of the Prophet [may peace be upon him] and the grave of Hadrat 'Uthman رضی اللہ عنہ away from their graves).",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih

Sa'd said: I had an earnest desire to hear it directly from Sa'd, so I met him and narrated to him what (his son) Amir had narrated to me, whereupon he said: Yes, I did hear it.

I heard Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) say about 'Ali رضی اللہ عنہ as he left him behind in one of his campaigns (that was Tabuk). 'Ali رضی اللہ عنہ said to him: Allah's Messenger, you leave me behind along with women and children. Thereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said to him: Aren't you satisfied with being unto me what Aaron was unto Moses but with this exception that there is no prophethood after me. And I (also) heard him say on the Day of Khaibar: I would certainly give this standard to a person who loves Allah and his Messenger, and Allah and his Messenger love him too. He (the narrator) said: We had been anxiously waiting for it, when he (the Holy Prophet) said: Call 'Ali. He was called and his eyes were inflamed. He applied saliva to his eyes and handed over the standard to him, and Allah gave him victory. (The third occasion is this) when the (following) verse was revealed: Let us summon our children and your children.

Umar bin Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ said: Never did I cherish for leadership but on that day. I came before him with the hope that I may be called for this, but Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) called 'Ali bin Abu Talib رضی اللہ عنہ and he conferred (this honour) upon him and said: Proceed on and do not look about until Allah grants you victory, and 'Ali رضی اللہ عنہ went a bit and then halted and did not look about and then said in a loud voice: Allah's Messenger, on what issue should I fight with the people?

The people spent the night thinking as to whom it would be given. When it was morning the people hastened to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) all of them hoping that that would be given to him. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Where is 'Ali bin Abu Talib? They said: Allah's Messenger, his eyes are sore. He then sent for him and he was brought and Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) applied saliva to his eyes and invoked blessings and he was all right, as if he had no ailment at all, and conferred upon him the standard.

Zaid, you have in fact earned a great virtue. Zaid, narrate to us what you heard from Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). He said: I have grown old and have almost spent my age and I have forgotten some of the things which I remembered in connection with Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ), so accept whatever I narrate to you, and which I do not narrate do not compel me to do that. He then said: One day Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) stood up to deliver sermon at a watering place known as Khumm situated between Mecca and Medina. He praised Allah, extolled Him and delivered the sermon and. exhorted (us) and said: Now to our purpose. O people, I am a human being. I am about to receive a messenger (the angel of death) from my Lord and I, in response to Allah's call, (would bid good-bye to you), but I am leaving among you two weighty things: the one being the Book of Allah in which there is right guidance and light, so hold fast to the Book of Allah and adhere to it. He exhorted (us) (to hold fast) to the Book of Allah and then said: The second are the members of my household I remind you (of your duties) to the members of my family. He (Husain) said to Zaid: Who are the members of his household? Aren't his wives the members of his family? Thereupon he said: His wives are the members of his family (but here) the members of his family are those for whom acceptance of Zakat is forbidden. And he said: Who are they? Thereupon he said: 'Ali and the offspring of 'Ali, 'Aqil and the offspring of 'Aqil and the offspring of Ja'far and the offspring of 'Abbas. Husain said: These are those for whom the acceptance of Zakat is forbidden. Zaid said: Yes.",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,sahih
