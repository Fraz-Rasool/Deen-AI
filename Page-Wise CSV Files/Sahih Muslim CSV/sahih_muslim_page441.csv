'Asim رضی اﷲ عنہ , ask for me (religious verdict about it) from Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). So 'Asim رضی اﷲ عنہ asked Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and he did not like this question and he disapproved of it so much that'Asim felt aggrieved at what he had heard from Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌).

Should he kill him, and then you would kill him, or how should he act?

Sahl said that they both invoked curses (and further said): I was along with people in the company of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). And when they had finished, Uwaimir said: Allah's Messenger, I shall have told a lie against her if I keep her (now).

He said that he (Ibn 'Umar رضی اﷲ عنہ) had been taking rest. He (Ibn 'Umar رضی اﷲ عنہ) heard my voice. and said: Are you Ibn Jubair? I said: Yes. He 'said: Come in. By Allah, it must be some (great) need which has brought you here at this Hour. So I got in and found him lying on a blanket reclining against a pillow stuffed with fibres of date-palm.

He said: Hallowed be Allah, yes, The first one who asked about it was so and so. he said: Messenger of Allah, tell me If one of us finds his wife committing adultery: what should he do? If he talks, that is something great, and if he keeps quiet that is also (something great) (which he cannot afford to do). Allah's Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) kept quiet (or some time). After some time he (that very person) came to him (Allah's Messenger) and said: I have been involved in that very cage about which I had asked you Allah the Exalted and Majestic then revealed (these) verses of Surah Nur: Those who accuse their wives (verse 6), and he (the Holy Prophet) recited them to him and admonished him, and exhorted him and informed him that the torment of the world is less painful than the torment of the Hereafter. He said: No, by Him Who sent you with Truth, I did not tell a lie against her. He (the Holy Prophet) then called her (the wife of that person who had accused her) and admonished her, and exhorted her, and informed her that the torment of this world is less painful than the torment of the Hereafter. She said: No, by Him Who sent thee with Truth, he is a liar. (it was) the man who started the swearing of oath and he swore in the name of Allah four times that he was among the truthful. and at the fifth turn he said: Let there be curse of Allah upon him if he were among the liars. Then the woman was called and she swore four times in the name of Allah that he (her husband) was among the liars, and at the fifth time (she said): Let there be curse upon her if he were among the truthful. He (the Holy Prophet) then effected separation between the two.",The Book of Invoking Curses,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih

If you tell the truth, it (dower) is the recompense for your having had the right to intercourse with her, and if you tell a lie against her, it is still more remote from you than she is. Zuhair said in his narration: Sufyan reported to us on the authority of 'Amr that he had heard Sa'id bin Jubair saying: I heard Ibn Umar (رضی اللہ عنہ) saying that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had said it.",The Book of Invoking Curses,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih
