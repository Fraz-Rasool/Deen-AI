One night, Abu Ayyub Ansari رضی اللہ عنہ got up and said (to himself): (How unfortunate it is) that we walk above the head of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌), so they went aside and spent the night in a nook and then told Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) about it whereupon Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: The lower storey is more comfortable (for me). but he (Abu Ayyub Ansari رضی اللہ عنہ) said: We (would not live) over the roof under which you live. So Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) shifted to the upper storey, whereas Abu Ayyub Ansari رضی اللہ عنہ shifted to the lower storey; and he (Abu Ayyub Ansari رضی اللہ عنہ ) used to prepare food for Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ); and when it was brought (back) to him he asked (to locate) the part, where his fingers had touched (the food), and he followed his fingers on that part where his fingers (those of the Holy Prophet) had touched it. (One day) he prepared food which contained garlic, and when it was returned to him he asked (to locate) the part which the fingers of Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had touched. It was said to him that he had not eaten (the food). He (Abd Ayyub Ansari رضی اللہ عنہ ) was distressed and went up to him (to the Holy Prophet) and said: Is it forbidden? But Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: No, (it is not forbidden), but I do not like it. and he (Abu Ayyub Ansari رضی اللہ عنہ ) said: I also do not like what you do not like or which you did not like. He (Abu Ayyub Ansari رضی اللہ عنہ ) said: (The Prophet did not eat garlic) as Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) was visited (by angels) and brought him the message of Allah.",The Book of Drink,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
5359,Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"A person came to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and said: I am hard pressed by hunger. He sent (message) to one of his wives (to procure food for him). but she said: By Him Who has sent you with Truth, I do not have anything but water. He (the Holy Prophet) then sent the (same) message to another, and she gave the same reply, until all of them gave the same reply: By Him Who has sent thee with the Truth, there is nothing with me but only water, whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Allah would show mercy to him who will entertain this guest tonight. A person from the Ansar stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, I (am ready to entertain). He took him to his house and said to his wife: Is there anything with you (to serve the gdest)? She said: No, but only a subsistence for our children. He said: Distract their attention with something, and when the guest enters extinguish the lamp and give him the impression that we are eating. So they sat down. and the guest had his meal. When it was morning he went to Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) who said: Allah was well pleased with what you both did for your guest this night.",The Book of Drink,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
5360,Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"A guest spent the night with a person from the Ansar who had nothing with him but food (sufficient) for his own self and his children.

It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed: Those who prefer the needy to their own selves in spite of the fact that they are themselves in pressing need (Lix. 9).",The Book of Drink,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
5361,Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"A man came to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) so that he should entertain him as a guest, but he had nothing with which he could entertain him. He, therefore, asked if there was any person who would entertain him (assuring the audience) that Allah would show mercy to him. A person from the Ansar who was called Abu Talha رضی اللہ عنہ stood up and he took him to his house. The rest of the hadith is the same and mention is (also) made in that about the revelation of the verse as narrated by Waki'.",The Book of Drink,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
5362,Miqdad رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"I and two of my companions were so much afflicted by hunger that we had lost our power of seeing and hearing. We presented ourselves (as guests) to the Companions of the Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ), but none amongst them would entertain us. So we came to Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ), and he took us to his residence and there were three goats. Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Milk these for us. So we milked them and every person amongst us drank his share and we set aside the share of Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). (It was his habit) to come during the night and greet (the people present there) in a manner that would not wake up one in sleep but make one who was awake hear it. He would then go to the mosque and say prayer, then go to the milk and drink it. Miqdad added: One night the Satan came to me when I had taken my share, and he said: Muhammad has gone to the Ansar, who would offer him hospitality and he would get what is with them, and he has no need for this draught (of milk). So I took (that milk) and drank it, and when it had penetrated deeply in my stomach and I was certain that there was no way out (but to digest it), the Satan aroused (my sense of) remorse and said: Woe be to thee! what have you done? You have taken the drink reserved for Muhammad! When he would come and he would not find it, he would curse you, and you would be ruined, and thus there would go (waste) this world and the Hereafter (for) you. There was a sheet over me; as I placed (pulled) it upon my feet, my head was uncovered and as I placed it upon my head, my feet were uncovered, and I could not sleep, but my two companions had gone to sleep for they had not done what I had done. There came Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ), and he greeted as he used to greet (by saying as-Salamu 'Alaikum). He then came to the mosque and observed prayer and then came to his drink (milk) and uncovered it, but did not find anything in it. He raised his head towards the sky, and I said (to myself) that he (the Holy Prophet) was going to invoke curse upon me and I would be thus ruined; but he (the Holy Prophet) said: Allah, feed him who fed me and give drink to him who provided me drink. I held tight the sheet upon myself (and when he had supplicated), I took hold of the knife and went to the goats (possessed by the Holy Prophet) so that I may slauhter one for Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) which was the fattest amongst them, and in fact all of them were milch goats; then I took hold of the vessel which belonged to the family of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) in which they used to milk and drink therefrom, and milked them in that until it swelled up with foam. I came to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and he said: Have you taken your share of the milk during the night? I said: Drink it. and he drank it; he then handed over (the vessel) to me and I said: Allah's Messenger, drink it, and he drank it and handed over (the vessel) to me again, I then perceived that Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had been satiated and I had got his blessings. I burst into laughter (so much) so that I fell upon the ground, whereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Miqdad, it must be one of your mischiefs. I said: Allah's Messenger, this affair of mind is like this and this. and I have done so. Thereupon. Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: This is nothing but a mercy from Allah. Why is it that you did not give me an opportunity so that we should have awakened our two friends and they would have got their share (of the milk)? I said: By Him Who has sent you with Truth. I do not mind whatever you give (to them), and whatever the (other) people happen to get, when I had got it along with you from among the people.",The Book of Drink,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih

5364,Abdul-Rahman bin Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"We were one hundred and thirty (persons) with Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: Does any one of You possess food? There was a person with (us) who had a sa' of flour or something about that, and it was kneaded. Then a tall polytheist with dishevelled hair came driving his flock of sheep. Thereupon Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: Would you like to sell it (any one of these goats) or offer it as a gift or a present? He said: No, (I am not prepared to offer as a gift), but I would sell it. He (the Holy Prophet) bought a sheep from him, and it was slaughtered and its meat was prepared, and Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) commanded that its liver should be roasted. He (the narrator) said: By Allah, none among one hundred and thirty persons was left whom Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had not given a part out of her liver; if anyone was present he gave it to him. but if he was absent it was set aside for him. And he (the Holy Prophet) filled two bowls (one with soup and the other with mutton) and we all ate out of them to our hearts' content, but (still) some part was (left) in (those) two bowls, and I placed it on the camel- (or words to the same effect).",The Book of Drink,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
5365,Abdul-Rabman bin Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"The people of Suffa were very poor. Once the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said (to his Companions): He who amongst you has food for two persons should take three (guests with him). and he who has with him food for four persons should take five or six (guests with him for entertaining them). It was (in accordance with these instructions of the Holy Prophet) that Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ brought three persons, and the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) brought ten persons (as guests to their respective houses). Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ had brought three persons (he himself, and myself), my father and my mother (along with therm). He (the narrator) said: I do not know whether he also said: My wife and one servant who was common between our house and that of Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ. Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ had had his evening meal with Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). He stayed here until night prayer had been offered. He then came back (to the house of Allah's Apostle) and stayed there until Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) felt drowsy and (Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ ) then came (back to his own house) when (a considerable) part of the night had been over, as Allah had desired. His wife said to him: What held you back from your guests? He said: Oh! have you not served them the evening meal (by this time)? She said: It was in fact served to them. but they refused to eat until you came. He ('Abdul-Rahman) said: I slunk away and bid myself. He (Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ ) said: O, you stupid fellow, and he reprimanded me, and said to the guests: Eat, though it may not be pleasant now. He said: By Allah. I will never eat it He ('Abdul-Rahman) said: By Allah. we did not take a morsel when from beneath that (there appeared) more until they had eaten to their fill, and lo! it was more than what it was before. Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ saw that and found that it was so or more than that. He said to his wife: Sister of Band Firis, what is th-is? She said: By the coolness of my eyes. it is in excess by three times over the previous one. Then Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ ate saying: That was from the Satan (viz. his vow for not eating the food). He then took a morsel out of that and then took it (the rest) to the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ), and it was kept there until morning, and during (those days) there was a covenant between us and some other people, and the period of covenant was over, and we had appointed twelve officials with every person amongst them. It is Allah only Who knows as to how many people were there with each of them. He sent (this food to them) and all of them ate out of it.",The Book of Drink,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
5366,Abdul-Rahman bin Abd Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"There came to our house some guests. It was a common practice with my father to (go) and talk to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) during the night. While going he said: 'Abdul-Rahman, entertain the guests. When it was evening we served the food to them, but they refused saying: So long as the owner of the house does not come and join us, we would not take the meal. I said to them: He ('Abd Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ ) is a stern person, and if you would not do that (if you do not take the food). I fear, I may be harmed by him, but they refused. As he (my father) came, the first thing he asked was: Have you served the guests? They (the people of the household) said: We have not served them sofar. He said: Did I not command 'Abdul-Rahman (to do this)? He ('Abdul-Rahman) said: I slunk away and kept myself away by that time. He again said: O stupid fellow, I ask you on oath that In case you hear my voice you come to me. I came and said: By Allah, there is no fault of mine. These are your guests; you may ask them. I provided them with food but they refused to eat until you came. He said to them: Why is it that you did not accept our food? By Allah, I shall not even take food tonight (as you have not taken). They said: By Allah, we would not take until you join us. Thereupon he Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ ) said: I have never seen a more unfortunate night than this. Woe be to thee! that you do not accept from us food prepared for you. He again said: What I did first (that is the taking of vow for not eating the food) was prompted by the Satan. Bring the food. The food was brought, and he ate by reciting the name of Allah and they also ate, and when it was morning he came to Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and said: Allah's Messenger, their oath (that of the guests) came to be true, but mine was not true, and after that he informed him of the whole incident. He said: Your oath came to be the most true and you are the best of them. He (the narrator) said. I do not know whether he made an atonement for it.",The Book of Drink,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
