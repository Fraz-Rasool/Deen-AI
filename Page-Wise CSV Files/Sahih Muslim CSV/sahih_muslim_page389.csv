We were also people large in number, and our (number) had reached six thousand. And on one side Khalid bin Walid رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ was in charge of the cavalry. And our horses at once turned back from our rear. And we could hardly hold our own when our horses were exposed, and the bedouins and the people whom we knew took to their heels.

Upon this 'Abbas bin Mirdis said: You allot the share of my booty and that of my horse between 'Uyaina and Aqra'. Both Uyaina and Aqra' are in no way more eminent than Mirdas (my father) in the assembly. I am in no way inferior to any one of these persons. And he who is let down today would not be elevated.

It was conveyed to him (the Holy Prophet) that the Ansar cherished a desire that they should be given (that very portion) which the people (of Quraish) had got. Upon this the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) stood up and, after having praised Allah and lauded Him, addressed them thus: O people of Ansar, did I not find you erring and Allah guided you aright through me, and (in the state of) being destitute and Allah made you free from want through me, and in a state of disunity and Allah united you through me, and they (the Ansar) said: Allah and His Messenger are most benevolent. He (again) said: Why do you not answer me? They said: Allah and His Messenger are the most benevolent. He said, If you wish you should say so and so, and the event (should take) such and such course (and in this connection he made a mention) of so many things. 'Amr is under the impression that he has not been able to remember them. He (the Holy Prophet) further said: Don't you feel happy (over this state of affairs) that the people should go away with goats and camels, and you go to your places along with the Messenger of Allah? The Ansar are inner garments (more close to me) and (other) people are outer garments. Had there not been migration, I would have been a man from among the Ansar. If the people were to tread a valley or a narrow path, I would tread the valley (chosen) by the Ansar or narrow path (trodden) by them. And you would soon find after me preferences (over you in getting material benefits). So you should show patience till you meet me at the Haud (Kauthar).",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih

He bestowed on Aqra' bin Habis رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ one hundred camels, and bestowed an equal (number) upon 'Uyaina, and bestowed on people among the elites of Arabia, and preferred them (to others) on that day, in the distribution (of spoils). Upon this a person said: By Allah, neither justice has been done in this distribution (of spoils), nor has the pleasure of Allah been sought in it. I (the narrator ) said: By Allah, I will certainly inform the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) about it. I came to him and informed him about what he had said. The colour of his (the Prophet's) face changed red like blood and he then said: Who would do justice, if Allah and His Messenger do not do justice? He further said: May Allah have mercy upon Moses; he was tormented more than this, but he showed patience. I said: Never would I convey him (the Holy Prophet) after this (unpleasant) narration.",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih

The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) took a handful out of that and bestowed it upon the people. He (the person who had met the Prophet at Ji'rana) said to him: Muhammad, do justice. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Woe be upon thee, who would do justice if I do not do justice, and you would be very unfortunate and a loser if I do not do justice. Upon this Umar bin Khattab رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said: Permit me to kill this hypocrite. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: May there be protection of Allah! People would say that I kill my companions. This man and his companions would recite the Qur'an but it would not go beyond their throat, and they swerve from it just as the arrow goes through the prey.",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
