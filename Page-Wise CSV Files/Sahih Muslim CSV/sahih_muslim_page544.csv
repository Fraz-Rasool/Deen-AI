6305,A'isha رضی اللہ عنہا reported:,"(one day) there sat together eleven women making an explicit promise amongst themselves that they would conceal nothing about their spouses. The first one said: My husband is a sort of the meat of a lean camel placed at the top of a hill, which it is difficult to climb up, nor (the meat) is good enough that one finds in oneself the urge to take it away (from the top of that mountain). The second one said: My husband (is so bad) that I am afraid I would not be able to describe his faults-both visible and invisible completely. The third one said: My husband is a long-statured fellow (i. e. he lacks intelligence). If I give vent to my feelings about him, he would divorce me, and if I keep quiet I would be made to live in a state of suspense (neither completely abandoned by him nor entertained as wife). The fourth one said: My husband is like the night of Tihama (the night of Hijaz and Mecca), neither too cold nor hot, neither there is any fear of him nor grief. The fifth one said: My husband is (like) a leopard as he enters the house, and behaves like a lion when he gets out, and he does not ask about that which he leaves in the house. The sixth one said: So far as my husband is concerned, he eats so much that nothing is left back and when he drinks he drinks that no drop is left behind. And when he lies down he wraps his body and does not touch me so that he may know my grief. The seventh one said: My husband is heavy in spirit, having no brightness in him, impotent, suffering from all kinds of conceivable diseases, heaving such rough manners that he may break my head or wound my body, or may do both. The eighth one said: My husband is as sweet as the sweet-smelling plant, and as soft as the softness of the hare. The ninth one said: My husband is the master of a lofty building, long-statured, having heaps of ashes (at his door) and his house is near the meeting place and the inn. The tenth one said: My husband is Malik, and how fine Malik is, much above appreciation and praise (of mine). He has many folds of his camel, more in number than the pastures for them. When they (the camels) hear the sound of music they become sure that they are going to be slaughtered. The eleventh one said: My husband is Abu Zara'. How fine Abu Zara' is! He has suspended in my ears heavy ornaments and (fed me liberally) that my sinews and bones are covered with fat. So he made me happy. He found me among the shepherds living in the side of the mountain, and he made me the owner of the horses, camels and lands and heaps of grain and he finds no fault with me. I sleep and get up in the morning (at my own sweet will) and drink to my heart's content. The mother of Abu Zara', how fine is the mother of Abu Zara'! Her bundles are heavily packed (or receptacles in her house are filled to the brim) and the house quite spacious. So far as the son of Abu Zara' is concerned, his bed is as soft as a green palm-stick drawn forth from its bark, or like a sword drawn forth from its scabbard, and whom just an arm of a lamb is enough to satiate. So far as the daughter of Abu Zara' is concerned, how fine is the daughter of Abu Zara', obedient to her father, obedient to her mother, wearing sufficient flesh and a source of jealousy for her co-wife. As for the slave-girl of Abu Zara', how fine is she; she does not disclose our affairs to others (outside the four walls of the house). She does not remove our wheat, or provision, or take it forth, or squander it, but she preserves it faithfully (as a sacred trust). And she does not let the house fill with rubbish. One day Abu Zara' went out (of his house) when the milk was churned in the vessels, that he met a woman, having two children like leopards playing with her pomegranates (chest) under her vest. He divorced me (Umm Zara') and married that woman (whom Abu Zara') met on the way. I (Umm Zara') later on married another person, a chief, who was an expert rider, and a fine archer: he bestowed upon me many gifts and gave me one pair of every kind of animal and said: Umm Zara', make use of everything (you need) and send forth to your parents (but the fact) is that even if I combine all the gifts that he bestowed upon me, they stand no comparison to the least gift of Abu Zara'. 'A'isha رضی اللہ عنہا reported that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said to me: I am for you as Abu Zara' was for Umm Zara'.",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih

6307,Miswar bin Makhramali رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"He heard Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) say, as he sat on the pulpit: The sons of Hisham bin Mughira have asked my permission to marry their daughter with 'Ali bin Abi Talib (that refers to the daughter of Abu Jahl for whom 'All had sent a proposal for marriage). But I would not allow them, I would not allow them, I would not allow them (and the only alternative possible is) that 'Ali should divorce my daughter (and then marry their daughter), for my daughter is part of me. He who disturbs her in fact disturbs me and he who offends her offends me.",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
6308,Miswar bin Makhramah رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) as saying: Fatima رضی اللہ عنہا is a part of me. He in fact tortures me who tortures her.,The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
6309,(Imam Zain-ul-'Abidin رضی اللہ عنہ) 'Ali bin Husain reported:,"When they came to Medina from Yazid b. Mu'awiya after the martyrdom of Husain bin 'Ali (رضی اللہ عنہ) Miswar bin Makhramah رضی اللہ عنہ met him and said to him: Is there any work for me which you ask me to do? I said to him: No. He again said to me: Would you not give me the sword of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) for I fear that the people may snatch it from you? By Allah, if you give that to me, no one would be able to take it away, so long as there is life in me. Verily 'Ali bin Abi Talib رضی اللہ عنہ sent a proposal of marriage to the daughter of Abu Jahl in spite of (the fact that his wife) Fatima (had been living in his house). Thereupon I heard Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) say while addressing the people on the pulpit. I was adolescing in those days. He said: Fatima رضی اللہ عنہا is a part of me and I fear that she may be put to trial in regard to religion. He then made a mention of his son-in law who had been from the tribe of 'Abd Shams and praised his behaviour as a son-in-law and said: Whatever he said to me he told the truth and whatever he promised he fulfilled it for me. I am not going to declare forbidden what is lawful and make lawful what is forbidden, but, by Allah, the daughter of Allah's Messenger and the daughter of the enemy of Allah can never be combined at one place.",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
6310,Ali bin Husain reported:,"Miswar bin Makhramah رضی اللہ عنہ informed him that 'Ali bin Abi Talib رضی اللہ عنہ sent the proposal of marriage to the daughter of Abu Jahl as he had Fatima رضی اللہ عنہا , the daughter of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ), (as his wife). When Fatima رضی اللہ عنہا heard about it, she came to Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and said: The people say that you never feel angry on account of your daughters and now 'Ali رضی اللہ عنہ is going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl. Makhramah said: Thereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) rose up and I heard him reciting Tashahhud and say: Now to the point. I gave a daughter of mine (Zainab) to Abu'l-'As bin Rabi, and he spoke to me and spoke the truth. Verily Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad, is a part of me and I do not approve that she may be put to any trial and by Allah, the daughter of Allah's Messenger cannot be combined with the daughter of God's enemy (as the co-wives) of one person. Thereupon 'Ali رضی اللہ عنہ gave up (the idea of his intended) marriage.",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih

He again said to her something secretly and she laughed. 'A'isha رضی اللہ عنہا further reported that she said to Fatima: What is that which Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said to you secretly and you wept and then said to you something secretly and you laughed? Thereupon she said: He informed me secretly of his death and so I wept. He then again informed me secretly that I would be the first amongst the members of his family to follow him and so I laughed.,The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
6313,A'isha رضی اللہ عنہا reported:,"We, the wives of Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ), were with him (during his last illness) and none was absent therefrom that Fatima رضی اللہ عنہا , who walked after the style of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ), came there, and when he saw her he welcomed her saying: You are welcome, my daughter. He their made her sit on his right side or on his left side. Then he said something secretly to her and she wept bitterly and when he found her (plunged) in grief he said to her something secretly for the second time and she laughed. I ('A'isha رضی اللہ عنہا ) said to her: Allah's Messenger has singled you amongst the women (of the family) for talking (to you something secretly) and you wept. When Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) recovered from illness, I said to her. What did Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) say to you? Thereupon she said: I am not going to disclose the secret of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). When Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) died, I said to her: I adjure you by the right that I have upon you that you should narrate to me what Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said to you. She said: Yes, now I can do that (so listen to it). When he talked to me secretly for the first time he informed me that Gibarel was in the habit of reciting the Qur'an along with him once or twice every year, but this year it had been twice and so he perceived his death quite near, so fear Allah and be patient (and he told me) that he would be a befitting forerunner for me and so I wept as you saw me. And when he saw me in grief he talked to me secretly for the second time and said: Fatima رضی اللہ عنہا , are you not pleased that you should be at the head of the believing women or the head of this Umma? I laughed and it was that laughter which you saw.",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
6314,`A'isha رضی اللہ عنہا reported:,"All the wives of Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) had gathered (in her apartment) during the days of his (Prophet's) last illness and no woman was left behind that Fatima رضی اللہ عنہا , who walked after the style of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ), came there. He welcomed her by saying: You are welcome, my daughter, and made her sit on his right side or on his left side, and then talked something secretly to her and Fatima رضی اللہ عنہا wept. Then he talked something secretly to her and she laughed. I said to her: What makes you weep? She said: I am not going to divulge the secret of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). I (`A'isha رضی اللہ عنہا ) said: I have not seen (anything happening) like today, the happiness being more close to grief (as I see today) when she wept. I said to her: Has Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) singled you out for saying something leaving us aside? She then wept and I asked her what he said, and she said: I am not going to divulge the secrets of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). And when he died I again asked her and she said that he (the Holy Prophet) told her: Gabriel used to recite the Qur'an to me once a year and for this year it was twice and so I perceived that my death had drawn near, and that I (Fatima) would be the first amongst the members of his family who would meet him (in the Hereafter). He shall be my good forerunner and it made me weep.

What is in store (in the next world) for Allah's-Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) is better than (this worldly life). She said: I weep not because I am ignorant of the fact that what is in store for Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) (in the next world) is better than (this world), but I weep because the revelation which came from the Heaven has ceased to come. This moved both of them to tears and they began to weep along with her.",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih

Abu Talha رضی اللہ عنہ came (home) ; she presented to him the supper. He took it and drank water. She then embellished herself which she did not do before. He (Abu Talha رضی اللہ عنہ) had a sexual intercourse with her and when she saw that he was satisfied after sexual intercourse with her, she said: Abu Talha رضی اللہ عنہ, if some people borrow something from another family and then (the members of the family) ask for its return, would they resist its return? He said: No. She said: I inform you about the death of your son. He was annoyed, and said: You did not inform me until I had a sexual intercourse with you and you later on gave me information about my son. He went to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and informed him what had happened. Thereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: May Allah bless both of you in the night spent by you! He (the narrator) said: She became pregnant. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was in the course of a journey and she was along with him and when Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) came back to Medina from the journey he did not enter (his house) (during the night). When the people came near Medina, she felt the pangs of delivery. He (Abu Talha) remained with her and Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) proceeded on. Abu Talha said: O Lord, you know that I love to go along with Allah's Messenger ﷺ when he goes out and enter along with him when he enters and I have been detained as Thou seest. Umm Sulaim رضی اللہ عنہا said: Abu Talha رضی اللہ عنہ, I do not feel (so much pain) as I was feeling formerly, so better proceed on. So we proceeded on and she felt the pangs of delivery as they reached (Medina) and a child was born and my mother said to me: Anas رضی اللہ عنہ, none should suckle him until you go to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) tomorrow morning. And when it was morning I carried him (the child) and went along with him to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). He said: I saw that he had in his hand the instrument for the cauterisation of the camels. When he saw me. he said: This is, perhaps, what Umm Sulaim رضی اللہ عنہا has given birth to. I said: Yes. He laid down that instrument on the ground. I brought that child to him and placed it in his lap and Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) asked Ajwa dates of Medina to be brought and softened them in his month. When these had become palatable he placed them in the mouth of that child. The child began to taste them.
