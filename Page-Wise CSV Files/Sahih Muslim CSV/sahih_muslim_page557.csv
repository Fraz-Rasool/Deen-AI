She said: Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) has invoked curse upon me that I should not grow in age and thus I would never grow in age, or she said, in my (length) of life. Umm Sulaim went out wrapping her head-dress hurriedly until she met Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). He said to her: Umm Sulaim رضی اللہ عنہا , what is the matter with you? She said: Allah's Apostle, you invoked curse upon my orphan girl. He said: Umm Sulaim رضی اللہ عنہا , what is that? She said: She (the orphan girl) states you have cursed her saying that she might not grow in age or grow in life. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) smiled and then said: Umm Sulaim رضی اللہ عنہا , don't you know that I have made this term with my Lord. And the term with my Lord is that I said to Him: 1 am a human being and I am pleased just as a human being is pleased and I lose temper just as a human being loses temper, so for any person from amongst my Ummah whom I curse and he in no way deserves it, let that, O Lord, be made a source of purification and purity and nearness to (Allah) on the Day of Resurrection.","The Book of Virtue, Enjoining Good Manners, and Joining of the Ties of Kinship",Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
