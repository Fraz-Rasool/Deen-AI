3245,Ata' reported:,"The House was burnt during the time of Yazid bin Muawiya when the people of Syria had fought (in Mecca). And it happened with it (the Ka'ba) what was (in store for it). Ibn Zubair (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ) felt it (in the same state) until the people came in the season (of Hajj). (The idea behind was) that he wanted to exhort them or incite them (to war) against the people of Syria. When the people had arrived he said to them: O people, advise me about the Ka'ba. Should I demolish it and then build it from its very foundation, or should I repair whatever has been damaged of it? Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said: An idea has occurred to me according to which I think that you should only repair (the portion which has been) damaged, and leave the House (in that very state in which) people embraced Islam (and leave those very stones in the same state) when people embraced Islam, and over which Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had raised it. Thereupon Ibn Zubair رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said: It the house of any one of you is burnt, he would not be contented until he had reconstructed it, then what about the House of your Lord (which is far more Important than your house)? I would seek good advice from my Lord thrice and then I would make up (my mind) about this affair. After seeking good advice thrice, he made up his mind to demolish it. The people apprehended that calamity might fall from heaven on those persons who would be first to climb (over the building for the purpose of demolishing it), till one (took up courage, and ascended the roof), and threw down one of its stones. When the people saw no calamity befalling him, they followed him, demolished it until it was razed to the ground. Then Ibn Zubair رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ erected pillars and hung cartains on them (in order to provide facilities to the people for observing the time of its construction). And the walls were raised; and Ibn Zubair رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said: I heard 'A'isha (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا) say that Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) had observed: If the people had Rot recently (abandoned) unbelief, find I had means enough to reconstruct it, which I had not, I would have definitely excompassed in it five cubits of area from Hijr. And I would also have constructed a door for the people to enter, and a door for their exit. I today have (the means to spend) and I entertain no fearfrom the side of people (that they would protest against this change). So he added five cubits of area from the side of Hatim to it that there appeared (the old) foundation (upon which Hadrat Ibrahim had built the Ka'ba). and the people saw that and it was upon this foundation that the wall was raised. The length of the Ka'ba was eighteen cubits. when addition was made to it (which was in its breadth), then naturally the length appears to be) small (as compared with its breadth). Then addition of ten cubits (of area) was made in its length (also). Two doors were also constructed, one of which (was meant) for entrance and the other one for exit. When Ibn Zubair (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ ) was killed, Hajjaj wrote to 'Abdul-Malik (bin Marwan) informing him about it, and telling him that Ibn Zubair (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ) had built (the Ka'ba) on those very foundations (which were laid by Ibrahim) and which reliable persons among the Meccans had seen. 'Abdul-Malik wrote to him: We are not concerned with the censuring of Ibn Zubair رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ in anything. Keep intact the addition made by him in the side of length, and whatever he has added from the side of Hijr revert to (its previous) foundation, and wall up the door which he had opened. Thus Hajjaj at the command of Abdul-Malik) demolished it (that portion) and rebuilt it on (its previous) foundations.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
3246,Abdullah bin 'Ubaid reported:,"Harith bin 'Abdullah led a deputation to 'Abdul-Malik bin Marwan during his caliphate. 'Abdul-Malik said: I do riot think that Abu Khubaib (i.e. Ibn Zabair) had heard from 'A'isha (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا) (about the intended wish of the Prophet ﷺ In regard to the alteration of the Ka'ba). Harith said: Yes, I myself did hear from her. He ('Abdul-Malik) said: Well, tell me what you heard from her. He stated that she (Hadrat 'A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا ) had said that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) remarked: Verily your people have reduced (the area) of the House from its (original foundations, and if they had not recently abandoned polytheism (and embraced Islam) I would have reversed it to (those foundations) which they had left out of it. nd if your people would take initiative after me in rebuilding it, then come along with me so that I should show you what they have left out of it. He showed her about fifteen cubits of area from the side of Hatim (that they had separated). This is the narration transmitted by 'Abdullah bin Ubaid. Walid bin 'Ata' has, however, made this addition to it: Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: I would have made two doors on the level of the ground (facing) the east and the west. Do you know why your people raised the level of its door (i. e. the door of the Ka'ba)? She said: No. He said: (They did it) out of vanity so that (they might be in a position) to grant admittance to him only whom they wished. When a person intended to get into it, they let him climb (the stairs), and as he was about to enter, they pushed him and he fell down. 'Abdul-Malik said to Harith; Did you yourself hear her saying this? He said: Yes. He (Harith) said that he ('Abdul-Malik) scratched the ground with his staff for some time and then said: I wish I had left his (Ibn Zubair's) work there.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih

3248,Abu Qaza'ah reported:,"While Abdul-Malik bin Marwan was circumambulating the Ka'ba he said: May Allah ruin Ibn Zubair that he lies in attributing to the Mother of the Faithful, as he says: I heard her stating that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had said: 'A'isha, if your people had not been new converts to Islam, I would have demolished the House and would have added (in it area) from the Hijr for your people have reduced the area from its foundations. Harith bin 'Abdullah bin Abu Rabi'a said: Commander of the Faithful, don't say that, for I heard the Mother of the Faithful saying this, whereupon he said: If I had heard this before demolishing it, I would have left it in the state in which Ibn Zabair رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ had built it.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
3249,A'isha (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا) reported:,"I asked Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) about the wall, circumpassing the House (i. e. whether the wall on the side of Hijr was included in the Ka'ba). He said, Yes. I said: Then why did they not include it in the House? He said: 'Your people ran short of the means (to do so). I said: Why is it that the level of its door is raised high? He said: Your people did it so that they should admit one whom they liked, and forbid him whom they disliked, and if your people were not new converts to faith, and I did not apprehend that their hearts would feel agitated at this. I would have definitely included (the area of) this wall-in the House and would have brought the door to the level of the ground.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
