The year is constituted of twelve months, of which four are sacred; three of them consecutive, viz. Dhu'l-Qa'da, Dhu'l- Hijja and Muharram, and also Rajab the month of Mudar which comes between Jumada and Sha'ban. He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) then said: which month is this? We said Allah and His Messenger know best.

We said: Yes. He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) said: Which city is this? We said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) remained silent until we thought that he would give it another name. He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) said: Is it not the Balda (the city of Mecca)? We said: Yes. He said: What day is this? We said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He (the Holy Prophet) remained silent until we thought that he would give it another name.

Thereupon he said: Your blood, your property (Muhammad, one of the narrators, said: I think, he also said this) and your honour are sacred to you like the sacredness of this day of yours, in this city of yours, and in this month of yours. You will soon meet your Lord and He will ask you about your deeds. So do not turn after me unbelievers (or misguided), some of you striking the necks of the others. Behold I let him who is present convey to him who is absent, for many a one whom a message is conveyed has a more retentive memory than one who hears. He again said: Behold! have I not delivered (the message) to you? This hadith has been narrated through another chain of transmitters, but with a slight variation of words.","The Book of Oaths, Muharibin, Qasas (Retaliation), and Diyat (Blood Money)",Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih

He said: I am more insignificant among my people than this (that I would not be able to get this benefit from my tribe). He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) threw the strap towards him (the claimant of the blood-wit) saying: Take away your man. The man took him away, and as he returned, Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: If he kills him, he will be like him.
