7353,Muhammad bin Munkadir reported:,As I saw Jabir bin 'Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہ taking an oath in the name of Allah that it was Ibn Sa'id who was the Dajjal I said: Do you take an oath in the name of Allah? Thereupon he said: I heard 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ taking an oath in the presence of Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) to this effect but Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) did not disapprove of it.,The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7354,Abdullah bin Umar رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"'Umar bin Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ went along with Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) in the company of some persons to Ibn Sayyad that he found him playing with children near the battlement of Bani Maghala and Ibn Sayyad was at that time just at the threshold of adolescence and he did not perceive (the presence of Holy Prophet) until Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) struck his back with his hands. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Ibn Sayyad, don't you bear witness that I am the messenger of Allah? Ibn Sayyad looked toward him and he said: I bear witness to the fact that you the messenger of the unlettered. Ibn Sayyad said to the Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ): Do you bear witness to the fact that I am the messenger of Allah? Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) rejected this and said: I affirm my faith in Allah and in His messengers. Then Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said to him: What do you see? Ibn Sayyad said: It is a Dukh. Thereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: May you be disgraced and dishonoured, you would not not be able to go beyond your rank. 'Umar bin Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ said: Allah's Messenger, permit me that I should strike his neck. Thereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: If he is the same (Dajjal) who would appear near the Last Hour, you would not be able to overpower him, and if he is not that there is no good for you to kill him.",The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7355,Abdullah bin 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ further narrated:,"After some time Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and Ubayy bin Ka'b رضی اللہ عنہ went towards the palm trees where Ibn Sayyad was. When Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) went near the tree he hid himself behind a tree with the intention of hearing something from Ibn sayyad before Ibn Sayyad could see him, but Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) saw him on a bed with a blanket around him from which a murmuring sound was being heard and Ibn Sayyad's mother saw Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) behind the trunk of the palm tree. She said to Ibn Sayyad: Saf (that being his name), here is Muhammad. Thereupon Ibn Sayyad jumped up murmuring and Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: If she had left him alone he would have made things clear.",The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7356,Abdullah bin Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said:,"Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) stood up amongst the people and lauded Allah as He deserved, then he made a mention of the Dajjal and said: I warn you of him and there is no Prophet who has not warned his people against the Dajjal. Even Noah warned (against him) but I am going to tell you a thing which no Prophet told his people. You must know that he (the Dajjal) is one-eyed and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is not one-eyed. Ibn Shihab said: 'Umar b. Thabit al-Ansari informed me that some of the Companions of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) informed him that the day when Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) warned people against the Dajjal, he also said: There would be written between his two eyes (the word) Kafir (infidel) and everyone who would resent his deeds would be able to read or every Muslim would be about to read, and he also said: Bear this thing in mind that none amongst you would be able to see Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, until he dies.",The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7357,Abdullah bin Umar رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) went along with him in the company of some persons and there was Umar bin Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ also amongst them till they saw Ibn Sayyad as a young boy just on the threshold of adolescence playing with children near the battlement of Bani Mu'awiya; the rest of the hadith is the same but with these concluding words: Had his mother left him (to murmur) his matter would have become clear.,The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih

The rest of the hadith is the same as narrated by Ibn Umar رضی اللہ عنہ (in which there is a mention of) setting out of Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) along with Ubayy bin Ka'b رضی اللہ عنہ towards the date-palm trees.,The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7359,Nafi' reported:,"Ibn 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ met Ibn Si'id on some of the paths of Medina and he said to him a word which enraged him and he was so much swollen with anger that the way was blocked. Ibn 'Umar went to Hafsa and informed her about this. Thereupon she said: May Allah have mercy upon you, why did you incite Ibn Sayyad in spite of the fact that you knew it would be the extreme anger which would make Dajjal appear in the world?",The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7360,Nafi' reported:,"Ibn 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said: I met lbn Sayyad twice and said to some of them (his friends): You state that it was he (the Dajjal). He said: By Allah, it is not so. I said: You have not told me the truth; by Allah some of you informed me that he would not die until he would have the largest number of offspring and huge wealth and it is he about whom it is thought so. Then Ibn Sayyad talked to us. I then departed and met him again for the second time and his eye had been swollen. I said: What has happened to your eye? He said: I do not know. I said: This is in your head and you do not know about it? He said: If Allah so wills He can create it (eye) in your staff. He then produced a sound like the braying of a donkey. Some of my companions thought that I had struck him with the staff as he was with me that the staff broke into pieces, but, by Allah, I was not conscious of it. He then came to the Mother of the Faithful (Hafsa) and narrated it to her and she said: What concern you have with him? Don't you know that Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said that the first thing (by the incitement of which) he would come out before the public would be his anger?",The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih

If anyone sees that, let him go to the river which he thinks is fire and close his eyes, then lower his head and drink from it, for it is cool water.

He said that the Dajjal would appear and there would be along with him water and fire and what the people would see as water that would be fire and that would burn and what would appear as fire that would be water and any one of you who would see that should plunge in that which he sees as fire for it would be sweet, pure water, and 'Uqba رضی اللہ عنہ said: I also heard it, testifying Hudhaifa رضی اللہ عنہ.",The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih

7373,An-Nawwas bin Sam`an رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) made a mention of the Dajjal one day in the morning. He ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) sometimes described him to be insignificant and sometimes described (his turmoil) as very significant (and we felt) as if he were in the cluster of the date-palm trees. When we went to him (to the Holy Prophet) in the evening and he read (the signs of fear) in our faces, he ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: What is the matter with you? We said: Allah's Messenger, you made a mention of the Dajjal in the morning (sometimes describing him) to be insignificant and sometimes very important, until we began to think as if he were present in some (near) part of the cluster of the date-palm trees. Thereupon he ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: I harbor fear in regard to you in so many other things besides the Dajjal. If he comes forth while I am among you, I shall contend with him on your behalf, but if he comes forth while I am not amongst you, a man must contend on his own behalf and Allah would take care of every Muslim on my behalf (and safeguard him against his evil). He (Dajjal) would be a young man with twisted, contracted hair, and a blind eye. I compare him to `Abd-ul-`Uzza b. Qatan. He who amongst you would survive to see him should recite over him the opening verses of Sura Kahf (xviii). He would appear on the way between Syria and Iraq and would spread mischief right and left. O servant of Allah! adhere (to the path of Truth). We said: Allah's Messenger, how long would he stay on the earth? He ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: For forty days, one day like a year and one day like a month and one day like a week and the rest of the days would be like your days. We said: Allah's Messenger, would one day's prayer suffice for the prayers of day equal to one year? Thereupon he ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: No, but you must make an estimate of time (and then observe prayer). We said: Allah's Messenger, how quickly would he walk upon the earth? Thereupon he ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Like cloud driven by the wind. He would come to the people and invite them (to a wrong religion) and they would affirm their faith in him and respond to him. He would then give command to the sky and there would be rainfall upon the earth and it would grow crops. Then in the evening, their pasturing animals would come to them with their humps very high and their udders full of milk and their flanks stretched. He would then come to another people and invite them. But they would reject him and he would go away from them and there would be drought for them and nothing would be left with them in the form of wealth. He would then walk through the waste land and say to it: Bring forth your treasures, and the treasures would come out and collect (themselves) before him like the swarm of bees. He would then call a person brimming with youth and strike him with the sword and cut him into two pieces and (make these pieces lie at a distance which is generally) between the archer and his target. He would then call (that young man) and he will come forward laughing with his face gleaming (with happiness) and it would be at this very time that Allah would send Jesus, son of Mary, and he will descend at the white minaret in the eastern side of Damascus wearing two garments lightly dyed with saffron and placing his hands on the wings of two Angels. When he would lower his head, there would fall beads of perspiration from his head, and when he would raise it up, beads like pearls would scatter from it. Every non-believer who would smell the odor of his self would die and his breath would reach as far as he would be able to see. He would then search for him (Dajjal) until he would catch hold of him at the gate of Ludd and would kill him. Then a people whom Allah had protected would come to Jesus, son of Mary, and he would wipe their faces and would inform them of their ranks in Paradise and it would be under such conditions that Allah would reveal to Jesus these words: I have brought forth from amongst My servants such people against whom none would be able to fight; you take these people safely to Tur. And then Allah would send Gog and Magog and they would swarm down from every slope. The first of them would pass the lake of Tiberias and drink out of it. And when the last of them would pass, he would say: There was once water there. Jesus and his companions would then be besieged here (at Tur, and they would be so much hard pressed) that the head of the ox would be dearer to them than one hundred dinars and Allah's Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would supplicate Allah, Who would send to them insects (which would attack their necks) and in the morning they would perish like one single person. Allah's Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would then come down to the earth and they would not find in the earth as much space as a single span which is not filled with their putrefaction and stench. Allah's Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would then again beseech Allah, Who would send birds whose necks would be like those of Bactrian camels and they would carry them and throw them where God would will. Then Allah would send rain which no house of clay or (the tent of) camels' hairs would keep out and it would wash away the earth until it could appear to be a mirror. Then the earth would be told to bring forth its fruit and restore its blessing and, as a result thereof, there would grow (such a big) pomegranate that a group of persons would be able to eat that, and seek shelter under its skin and milch cow would give so much milk that a whole party would be able to drink it. And the milch camel would give such (a large quantity of) milk that the whole tribe would be able to drink out of that and the milch sheep would give so much milk that the whole family would be able to drink out of that and at that time Allah would send a pleasant wind which would soothe (people) even under their armpits, and would take the life of every Muslim and only the wicked would survive who would commit adultery like asses and the Last Hour would come to them.",The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7374,This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Abdur Rahman bin Yazid binJabir with the same chain of transmitters but with this addition:,Gog and Magog would walk until they would reach the mountain of al-Khamar and it is a mountain of Bait-ul-Maqdis and they would say: We have killed those who are upon the earth. Let us now kill those who are In the sky and they would throw their arrows towards the sky and the arrows would return to them besmeared with blood. And in the narration of Ibn Hujr (the words are): I have sent such persons (Gog and Magog) that none would dare fight against them.,The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7375,Abu Sa'id al-Khudri رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) one day gave a detailed account of the Dajjal and in that it was also included: He would come but would not be allowed to enter the mountain passes to Medina. So he will alight at some of the barren tracts near Medina, and a person who would be the best of men or one from amongst the best of men would say to him: I bear testimony to the fact that you are Dajjal about whom Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) had informed us. The Dajjal would say: What is your opinion if I kill this (person), then I bring him back to life; even then will you harbour doubt in this matter? They would say: No. He would then kill (the man) and then bring him back to life. When he would bring that person to life, he would say: By Allah, I had no better proof of the fact (that you are a Dajjal) than at the present time (that you are actually so). The Dajjal would then make an attempt to kill him (again) but he would not be able to do that.",The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7376,,This hadith has been narrated by Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters.,The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7377,Abu Sa'id al-Khudri رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) as saying: The Dajjal would come forth and a person from amongst the believers would go towards him and the armed men of the Dajjal would meet him and they would say to him: Where do you intend to go? He would say: I intend to go to this one who is coming forth. They would say to him: Don't you believe in our Lord? He would say: There is nothing hidden about our Lord. They would say: Kill him. Then some amongst them would say: Has your master (Dajjal) not forbidden you to kill anyone without (his consent)? And so they would take him to the Dajjal and when the believer would see him, he would say: O people. he is the Dajjil about whom Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) has informed (us). The Dajjal would then order for breaking his head and utter (these words): Catch hold of him and break his head. He would be struck even on his back and on his stomach. Then the Dajjal would ask him: Don't you believe in me? He would say: You are a false Masih. He would then order him to be torn (into pieces) with a saw from the parting of his hair up to his legs. After that the Dajjal would walk between the two pieces. He would then say to him: Stand, and he would stand erect. He would then say to him: Don't you believe in me? And the person would say: It has only added to my insight concerning you (that you are really the Dajjal). He would then say: O people, he would not behave with anyone amongst people (in such a manner) after me. The Dajjal would try to catch hold of him so that he should kill him (again). The space between his neck and collar bone would be turned into copper and he would find no means to kill him. So he would catch hold of him by his hand and feet and throw him (into the air) and the people would think as if he had been thrown in the Hell-Fire whereas he would be thrown in Paradise. Thereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: He would be the most eminent amongst persons in regard to martyrdom in the eye of the Lord of the world.",The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
