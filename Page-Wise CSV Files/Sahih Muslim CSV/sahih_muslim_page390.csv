2450,,This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Jabir bin 'Abdullah رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ through another chain of transmitters.,The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2451,Abu Said Khudri رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ reported:,"'Ali رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ sent some gold alloyed with dust to the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌), and the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) distributed that among four men, al-Aqra bin Habis Hanzali and Uyaina bin Badr al-Fazari and 'Alqama bin 'Ulatha al-'Amiri رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ , then to one person of the tribe of Kilab and to Zaid al-Khair al-Ta'l, and then to one person of the tribe of Nabhan. Upon this the people of Quraish felt angry and said: He (the Holy Prophet) gave to the chiefs of Najd and ignored us. Upon this the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: I have done it with a view to conciliating between them. Then there came a person with thick beard, prominent cheeks, deep sunken eyes and protruding forehead and shaven head. He said: Muhammad, fear Allah. Upon this the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: If I disobey Allah, who would then obey Him? Have I not been (sent as the) most trustworthy among the people of the world? But you do not repose trust in me. That person then went back. A person among the people then sought permission (from the Holy Prophet) for his murder. According to some, it was Khalid bin Walid رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ who sought the permission. Upon this the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌), said: From this very person's posterity there would arise people who would recite the Qur'an, but it would not go beyond their throat; they would kill the followers of Islam and would spare the idol-worshippers. They would glance through the teachings of Islam so hurriedly just as the arrow passes through the pray. If I were to ever find them I would kill them like 'Ad.",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2452,Abu Said al-Khudri رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ reported:,"'Ali bin Abu Talib sent to the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) from Yemen some gold alloyed with clay in a leather bag dyed in the leaves of Mimosa flava. He distributed it among four men. 'Uyaina bin Hisna, Aqra' bin Habis and Zaid al-Khail, and the fourth one was either Alqama bin 'Ulatha or 'Amir bin Tufail. A person from among his (Prophet's) Companions said: We had a better claim to this (wealth) than these (persons). This (remark) reached the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) upon which he said: Will you not trust me, whereas I am a trustee of Him Who is in the heaven? The news come to me from the heaven morning and evening. Then there stood up a person with deep sunken eyes, prominent cheek bones, and elevated forehead, thick beard, shaven head, tucked up loincloth, and he said: Messenger of Allah, fear Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Woe to thee. Do I not deserve most to fear Allah amongst the people of the earth? That man then returned. Khalid b. Walid then said: Messenger of Allah, should I not strike his neck? Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: Perhaps he may be observing the prayer. Khalid said: How many observers of prayer are there who profess with their tongue what is not in their heart? Upon this the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: I have not been commanded to pierce through the hearts of people, nor to split their bellies (insides). He again looked at him and he was going back. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: There would arise a people from the progeny of this (man) who would recite the Qur'an glibly, but it would not go beyond their throats; they would (hurriedly) pass through (the teachings of their) religion just as the arrow passes through the prey. I conceive that he (the Holy Prophet) also said this: If I find them I would certainly kill them as were killed the (people of) Thamud.",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2453,"This hadith has been narrated through another chain of transmitters and (the narrator) made a mention of elevated forehead, but he made no mention of tucked-up loin cloth and made this addition:","There stood up 'Umar bin Khattab رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ , and said: Should I not strike his neck? Upon this he said: No. Then he turned away, and Khalid the Sword of Allah stood up against him, and said: Prophet of Allah. shall I not strike off his neck? He said, No, and then said: A people would rise from his progeny who would recite the Book of Allah glibly and fluently. 'Umar said: I think he (the Holy Prophet) also said this: If I find them I would certainly kill them like Thamud.",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2454,,"It was narrated from Umarah bin Al-Qaqa with this chian (a similar hadith as no. 2452) and he said: ""...between four men: Zaid Al-Khail, Al Aqra bin' bin Habis, 'Uyaynah or Amr bin At-tufail."" And he said: ""...between four men: A high forehead,"" like the report of Abdul-Wahid. And he said: 'There will emerge from the progeny of this men people who.."" but he did not say: ""If live to see them then I will certainly kill them like the killing of Thamud.""",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2455,"Abu Salama and 'Ata' bin Yasar came to Abu Sa'id al-Khudri رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ and asked him about Haruriya, saying:","Did you hear the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) making a mention of them? He (Abu Sai'd al-Khudri) said: I don't know who the Haruriya are, but I heard the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) as saying: There would arise in this nation (and he did not say out of them ) a people and you would hold insignificant your prayers as compared with their prayers. And they would recite the Qur'an which would not go beyond their throats and would swerve through the religion (as blank) just as a (swift) arrow passes through the prey. The archer looks at his arrow, at its iron head and glances at its end (which he held) in the tip of his fingers to see whether it had any stain of blood.",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2456,Abu Sai'd al-Khudri رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ reported:,"When we were in the company of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and he was distributing the spoils of war, there came to him Dhul-Khuwasira, one of Banu Tamim. He said: Messenger of Allah, do justice. Upon this the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Woe be upon thee! Who would do justice, if I do not do justice? You would be unsuccessful and incurring a loss, if I do not do justice. Upon this Umar bin Khattab رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said: Messenger of Allah, permit me to strike off his neck. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: Leave him, for he has friends (who would outwardly look to be so religious and pious) that everyone among you would consider his prayer insignificant as compared with their prayer, and his fast as compared with their fasts. They would recite the Qur'an but it would not go beyond their collar-bones. They would pass through (the teachings of Islam so hurriedly) just as the arrow passes through the prey. He would look at its Iron head, but would not find anything ticking) there. He would then see at the lowest end, but would not find anything sticking there. He would then see at its grip but would not find anything sticking to it. He would then see at its feathers and he would find nothing sticking to them (as the arrow would pass so quickly that nothing would stick to it) neither excrement nor blood. They would be recognised by the presence of a black man among them whose upper arms would be like a woman's breast, or like a piece of meat as it quivers, and they would come forth at the time when there is dissension among the people. Abu Sai'd رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said: I testify to the fact that I heard it from the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ), and I testify to the fact that 'Ali bin Abu Talib رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ fought against them and I was with him. He gave orders about that man who was sought for, and when he was brought in, and when I looked at him, he was exactly as the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had described him.",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2457,Abu Sa'id al-Khudri رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said:,"The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) made a mention of a sect that would be among his Ummah which would emerge out of the dissension of the people. Their distinctive mark would be shaven heads. They would be the worst creatures or the worst of the creatures. The group who would be nearer to the truth out of the two would kill them. The Apostle of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) gave an example (to give their description) or he said: A man throws an arrow at the prey (or he said at the target), and sees at its iron head, but finds no sign (of blood there), or he sees at the lowest end, but would not see or find any sign (of blood there). He would then see into the grip but would not find (anything) sticking to it. Abu Sai'd رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ then said: People of Iraq. it is you who have killed them.",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2458,Abu Sa'id al-Khudri رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ reported:,The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: A group would secede itself (from the Ummah) when there would be dissension among the Muslims. Out of the two groups who would be nearer the truth would kill them.,The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2459,Abu Sa'id al-Khudri رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ reported:,"Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) as saying: There would be two groups in my Ummah, and there would emerge another group (seceding itself from both of them), and the party nearer to the truth among the two would kill them (the group of the Khawarij).",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2460,It was narrated from Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ :,"The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: A group will secede at a time of division among the people, and they will be killed by the group that is closer to the truth.",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2461,Abu Sa'id al-Khudri رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ reported:,"The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) that a group (Khawarij) would emerge from the different parties (the party of Hadrat 'Ali and the party of Amir Mu'awiya), the group nearer the truth between the two would kill them.",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2462,Ali رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said:,"Whenever I narrate to you anything from the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) believe it to be absolutely true as falling from the sky is dearer to me than that of attributing anything to him (the Holy Prophet) which he never said. When I talk to you of anything which is between me and you (there might creep some error in it) for battle is an outwitting. I heard the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) as saying: There would arise at the end of the age a people who would be young in age and immature in thought, but they would talk (in such a manner) as if their words are the best among the creatures. They would recite the Qur'an, but it would not go beyond their throats, and they would pass through the religion as an arrow goes through the prey. So when you meet them, kill them, for in their killing you would get a reward with Allah on the Day of Judgement.",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2463,,A similar report (as no. 2462) was narrated from Al A'mash with this chain.,The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2464,"This hadith has been narrated on the authority of A'mash with the same chain of transmitters, but (these words) are not there:",They pass through the religion clean as the arrow passes through the prey.,The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2465,Abida narrated from 'Ali رضی اللہ عنہ that he made a mention of the Khawarij (and in this connection) said:,"There would be a person among them with a defective hand (or with a short hand) or a fleshy hand. If you were to exercise restraint, I would tell you what Allah has promised to those who would kill them on the order of Muhammad ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). I (the narrator) said to him: Did you hear it from Muhammad ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ )? He (Hadrat 'Ali) said: Yes, by the Lord of the Ka'bah; Yes, by the Lord of the Ka'bah; yes, by the Lord of the Ka'bah.",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2466,Abida said:,"I will not narrate to you except what I heard from him (Hadrat 'Ali رضی اللہ عنہ ), and then he narrated from him."" Then he narrated from 'Ali a hadith similar to that of Ayyub (no. 2464).",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2467,Zaid bin Wahb Juhani reported:,"He was among the squadron which was under the command of Ali رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ and which set out (to curb the activities) of the Khawarij. 'Ali رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said: O people, I heard the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) say: There would arise from my Ummah a people who would recite the Qur'an, and your recital would seem insignificant as compared with their recital, your prayer as compared with their prayer, and your fast, as compared with their fast. They would recite the Qur'an thinking that it supports them, whereas it is an evidence against them. Their prayer does not get beyond their collar bone; they would swerve through Islam just as the arrow passes through the prey. If the squadron which is to encounter them were to know (what great boon) has been assured to them by their Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) they would completely rely upon this deed (alone and cease to do other good deeds), and their (that of the Khawarij) distinctive mark is that there would be (among them) a person whose wrist would be without the arm, and the end of his wrist would be fleshy like the nipple of the breast on which there would be white hair. You would be marching towards Muawiya and the people of Syria and you would leave them behind among your children and your property (to do harm). By Allah, I believe that these are the people (against whom you have been commanded to fight and get reward) for they have shed forbidden blood, and raided the animals of the people. So go forth in the name of Allah (to fight against them). Salama b. Kuhail mentioned that Zaid b. Wahb made me alight at every stage, till we crossed a bridge. 'Abdullah b. Wahb al-Rasibi was at the head of the Khawarij when we encountered them. He ('Abdullah) said to his army: Throw the spears and draw out your swords from their sheaths, for I fear that they would attack you as they attacked you on the day of Harura. They went back and threw their spears and drew out their swords, and people fought against them with spears and they were killed one after another. Only two persons were killed among the people (among the army led by 'Ali) on that day. 'Ali رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said: Find out from among them (the dead bodies of the Khawarij) (the maimed). They searched but did not find him. 'Ali رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ then himself stood up and (walked) till he came to the people who had been killed one after another. He ('Ali رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ ) said: Search them to the last, and then ('Ali's companions) found him (the dead body of the maimed) near the earth. He ('Ali رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ) then pronounced Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Greatest) and then said, Allah told the Truth and His Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) conveyed it. Then there stood before him 'Abida Salmani who said: Commander of the Believers, by Allah, besides Whom there is no god but He, (tell me) whether you heard this hadith from the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). He said: Yes, by Allah, besides Whom there is no god but He. He asked him to take an oath thrice and he took the oath.",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2468,"Ubaidullah bin Abu Rafi' رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ , the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ), said:","When Haruria (the Khawarij) set out and as he was with 'Ali bin Abu Talib رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ they said, There is no command but that of Allah. Upon this 'Ali رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said: The statement is true but it is intentionally applied (to support) a wrong (cause). The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) described their characteristics and I found these characteristics in them. They state the truth with their tongue, but it does not go beyond this part of their bodies (and the narrator pointed towards his throat). The most hateful among the creation of Allah is one black man among them (Khawarij). One of his hand is like the teat of a goat or the nipple of the breast. When 'Ali bin Abu Talib رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ killed them, he said: Search (for his dead body). They searched for him, but they did not find it (his dead body). Upon this he said: Go (and search for him). By Allah, neither I have spoken a lie nor has the lie been spoken to me. 'Ali said this twice and thrice. They then found him (the dead body) in a rain. They brought (his dead) body till they placed it before him (Hadrat 'Ali). 'Ubaidullah said: And, I was present at (that place) when this happened and when 'Ali رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said about them. A person narrated to me from Ibn Hanain that he said: I saw that black man.",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2469,Abu Dharr رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ reported:,"Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) as saying: Verily there would arise from my Ummah after me or soon after me a group (of people) who would recite the Qur'an, but it would not go beyond their throats, and they would pass clean through their religion just as the arrow passes through the prey, and they would never come back to it. They would be the worst among the creation and the creatures. Ibn Samit (one of the narrators) said: I met Rafi' bin 'Amr Ghifari, the brother of Al-Hakam Ghifari and I said: What is this hadith that I heard from Abu Dharr, i. e. so and so? and then I narrated that hadith to him and said: I heard it from the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ).",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2470,Yusair bin 'Amr reported:,He inquired of Sahl bin Hunaif رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ : Did you hear the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) making a mention of the Khawarij? He said: I heard him say (and he pointed with his hand towards the east) that these would be a people who would recite the Qur'an with their tongues and it would not go beyond their collar bones. They would pass clean through their religion just as the arrow passes through the prey.,The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
2471,,"This hadith had been transmitted by Sulaiman Shaibani with the same chain of narrators (and the words are), There would arise out of (this group) many a group",The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih

2474,This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Shu'ba with the same chain of transmitters (and the words of the Holy Prophet ﷺ) are:,Sadaqa is not permissible for us.,The Book of Zakat,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
