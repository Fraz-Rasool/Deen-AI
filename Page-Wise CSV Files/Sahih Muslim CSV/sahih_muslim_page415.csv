3079,Hisham bin 'Urwa reported on the authority of his father who narrated from 'A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا . He said to 'A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا :,"I think if a person does not run between al- Safa' and al-Marwa, It does not do any harm to him (so far as Hajj is concerned). She said: Why (do you think so)? I said: For Allah says: Verily al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the Signs of Allah (ii. 158) (to the end of the verse), whereupon she said: Allah does not complete the Hajj of a person or his Umra if he does not observe Sa'i between al-Safa' and al-marwa; and if it were so as you state, then (the wording would have been (fala janah an la yatufu biha) [ There is no harm for him if he does not circumambulate between them']. Do you know in what context (this verse was revealed)? (It was revealed in this context) that the Ansar in the Days of Ignorance pronounced the Talbiya for two idols. (fixedl on the bank of the river which were called Isaf and Na'ila. The people went there, and then circumambulated between al-Safa' and al-Marwa and then got their heads shaved. With the advent of Islam they (the Muslims) did not like to circumambulate between them as they used to do during the Days of Ignorance. It was on account of this that Allah. the Exalted and Majestic, revealed: Verily al-Safe and al-Marwa are among the Signs of Allah to the end of the verse. She said: Then people began to observe Sa'i.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
3080,Hisham bin 'Urwa narrated on the authority of his father who reported: I said to 'A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا :,"I do not see any harm to me if I do not circumambulate between al-Safa' and al-Marwa. She said: On what ground do you say so? (I said: ) Since Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, says: Verily al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the Signs of Allah. It (your assertion) were (correct), it would have been said like this: There is no harm for him, that he should not circumambulate between them. It (this verse) has been revealed about the people of Ansar. Whenever they pronounced the Talbiya, they pronounced it in the name of al-Manat during the Days of Ignorance; so they (thought) that it was not permissible for them (for the Muslims) to circumambulate between and al-Marwa. When they (the Muslims) came with Allah's Apostle (may peace he upon him) for Hajj, they mentioned it to him. So Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed this verse. By my life, Allah will not complete the Hajj of one who has not circumambulated between al-Safa and al-Marwa.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
3081,Urwa bin Zabair رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ reported:,"I said to 'A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا , the wife of Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌): I do not see any (fault) in one who does not circumamblte between al-Safa' and al-Marwa, and I do not mind if I do not circumambulate between them, whereupon she said: O, the son of my sister, what you say is wrong. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) observed Sa'i and so did the Muslims. So it is a Sunnah (of the Prophet). And it was a common practice (with the pagan Arabs) that those who pronounced Talbiya for the wretched al-Manat, situated at Mushalla, did not observe Sa'i between al-Safa' and al-Marwa. With the advent of Islam, we asked Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) about this practice, and (it was on this occasion) that Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed this verse: Verily al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the Signs of Allah ; so he who performed Hajj or 'Umra it is no sin on him if he circumambulates them. And if it were as you state, (then the wording would have been): There is no harm for him, that he should not circumambulate round them. Zuhri said: I made a mention of that to Abu Bakr b. 'Abd al- Rahman b. al-Harith b. Hisham; he was impressed by that and said: This is what is called knowledge. And I have heard many a scholar saying: Many of the Arabs who did not circumambulate between al-Safa' and al-Marwa caid: Our circumambulation between these two hills is an act of ignorance; whereas others among the Ansar said: We have been commanded to circumambulate the House, and not Commanded to run between al-Safa' and al-Marwa. So Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed thia verse: Verily al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the Signs of Allah. Abu Bakr bin 'Abdul-Rahman said: I think that this (verse) has been revealed for such and such (persons).",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
3082,Urwa bin Zubair رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ reported:,"I asked 'A'isha ( رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا); the rest of the hadith is the same. And in this hadith (these words are also found): When they (the Companions of the Holy Prophet) asked Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) about this, they said: Messenger of Allah, we felt reluctant to circumambulate between al-Safa' and al-Marwa. Then Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed this verse: Verily al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the Signs of. Allah so he who perform Hajj or Umra it is no sin on him if he should circumambulate between them. 'A'isha ( رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا) said: Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) laid down this Sa'i between them as Sunnah (of the Holy Prophet). So it is not advisable for anyone to abandon this Sa'i between them.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
3083,Urwa bin Zabair narrated on the authority of 'A'isha (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا) who informed him:,"The Ansar and the people of the tribe of Ghassan before embracing Islam pronounced Talbiya for Manat, and so they avoided circumambulating between al-Safa' and al-Marwa, and it was a common practice with their forefather, that he who put on Ihram for Manat did not circumambulate between al-Safa' and al-Marwa. And when they embraced Islam, they asked Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) about it, and then Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed this verse: Verily al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the Signs of Allah ; so he who performs Hajj or Umra, for him there is no harm if he should circumambulate between them, and he who does good spontaneously-surely Allah is Bountiful in rewarding and Knowing.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
