3000,,"A hadith similar to of Ibn Uyaynah (no. 2999) was narrated from Amr bin Dinar, from Ibn Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ from the prophet ﷺ.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
3001,Muhammad bin 'Abdul-Rahman reported:,"A person from Iraq said to him to inquire from 'Urwa bin Zubair رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ for him whether a person who puts on Ihram for Hajj is allowed to put it off or not as he circumambulates the House. And if he says: No, it can't be put off, then tell him that there is a person who makes such an assertion. He (Muhammad bin 'Abdul-Rahman) then said: I asked him ( Urwa bin Zubair), where-upon he said: The person who has entered into the state of Ihram for Hajj cannot get out of it unless he has, completed the Hajj I (further) said (to him): (What) if a person makes that assertion? Thereupon he said: It is indeed unfortunate that he makes such an assertion. That person ('Iraqi) then met me and he asked me and I narrated to him (the reply of 'Urwa), whereupon he (the Iraqi) said: Tell him ('Urwa) that a person had informed him that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had done that; and why is it that Asma' رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا and Zubair رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ have done like this? He (Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Rahman) said: I went to him and made a mention of that to him, whereupon he ('Urwa) said: Who is he (the 'Iraqi)? I said: I do not know, whereupon he said: What is the matter that he does not come to me himself and ask me? I suppose he is an 'Iraqi. I said: I do not know, whereupon he said: He has told a lie. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) performed Hajj, and 'A'isha (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا) has told me that the first thing with which he commenced (the rituals) when he arrived at Mecca was that he performed ablution and then circumambulated the Ka'ba. Then Abu Bakr رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ performed Hajj and the first thing with which he commenced (the Hajj) as the circumambulation of the Ka'ba and nothing besides it. So did 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ . Then 'Uthman رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ performed Hajj and I saw that the first thing with which he commenced the Hajj was the circumambulation of the Ka'ba and nothing besides it. Then Mu'awiya رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ and Abdullah bin 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ did that. Then I performed Hajj with my father Zubair bin al-'Awwam رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ , and the first thing with which he commenced (Hajj) was the circumambulation of the House. He then did nothing besides it. I then saw the emigrants (Muhajirin) and the helpers (Ansar) doing like this and nothing besides it. And the last one whom I saw doing like this was Ibn 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ. And he did not break it (the Hajj) after performing 'Umra. And Ibn 'Umar رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ is with them. Why don't they ask him (to testify it)? And none amongst those who had passed away commenced (the rituals of Hajj) but by circumambulating the Ka'ba on their (first arrival) and they did not put off Ihram (without completing the Hajj), and I saw my mother and my aunt commencing (their Hajj) with the circumambulation of the House, and they did not put off Ihram. My mother informed me that she came and her sister, and Zubair رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ and so and so for 'Umra, and when they had kissed the corner (the Black Stone, after Sa'i and circumambulation), they put off Ihram. And he (the 'Iraqi) has told a lie in this matter.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
3002,Asma bint Abu Bakr (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا) reported:,"We set out (to Mecca) in a state of Ihram. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: He who has the sacrificial animal with him should remain in the state of Ihram, but he who has not the sacrificial animal with him should put off Ihram. As I had not the sacrificial animal with me, I put off Ihram. And since Zubair (her husband)- had the sacrificial animal with him, he did not put off Ihram. She (Asma رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا ) said: I put on my clothes and then went out and sat by Zabair رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ , whereupon he said: Go away from me, whereupon I said: Do you fear that I would jump upon you?",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
3003,Asma bint Abu Bakr (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا) said:,"We came for Hajj in the state of Ihram with Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). The rest of the hadith is the same except (for the words) that he (Zubair رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ) said: Keep away from me, keep away from me, whereupon I said: Do you fear that I will jump upon you?",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
3004,"Abdullah, the freed slave of Asma' bint Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with them), narrated that he used to hear Asma رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا, ' whenever she passed by Hajun, saying (these words):","May there be peace and blessing of Allah upon His Messenger. We used to stay here along with him with light burdens. Few were our rides, and small were our provisions. I performed 'Umra and so did my sister 'A'isha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا , and Zubair and so and so. And as we touched the House (performed circumambulation and Sa'i) we put off Ihram, and then again put on Ihram in the afternoon for Hajj. Harun (one of the narrators) in one of the narrations said: The freed slave of Asma' رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا and he did not mention 'Abdullah.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
3005,Muslim al-Qurri reported:,"I asked Ibn Abbas (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ) about Tamattu' in Hajj and he permitted it, whereas Ibn Zubair رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ had forbidden it. He (Ibn 'Abbas رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ) said: This is the mother of Ibn Zubair رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ who states that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had permitted it, so you better go to her and ask her about it. He (Muslim al-Qurri said): So we went to her and she was a bulky blind lady and she said: Verily Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) permitted it.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
3006,"It was narrated from Shubah with this chain (a hadith similar to no. 3005). As for (the narration of) Abdur Rahman, it mentions Mutah but it does not say ""Mutah in Hajj.""

3007,Muslim al-Qurri heardlbn 'Abbas (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ) saying:,"Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) entered into the state of Ihram for Umra and his Companions for Hajj. Neither Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) nor those among his Companions who had brought sacrificial animals with them put off Ihram, whereas the rest (of the pilgrims) did so. Talha b. Ubaidullah was one of those who had brought the sacrificial animals along with them so he did not put off Ihram.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
3008,This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Shu'ba with the same chain of transmitters but with this variation (of words):,Talha رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ and another person also were among those who had not brought the sacrificial animals with them and so they put off Ihram.,The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
3009,Ibn Abbas (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ) reported:,"They (the Arabs of pre-Islamic days) looked upon Umra during the months of Hajj as the greatest of sins on the earth. So they intercalated the month of Muharram for Safar and said: When the backs of their camels would become all right and traces (if the pilgrims) would be effaced (from the paths) and the month of Safar would be over, then Umra would be permissible for one who wants to perform it. When Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and his Companions came in the state of Ihram for performing Hajj on the fourth (of Dhu'l-Hijja) he (Allah's Apostle) commanded them to change their state of Ihram (from Hajj) to that of 'Umra. It was something inconceivable for them. So they said: Messenger of Allah, is it a complete freedom (of the obligation) of Ihram? Thereupon he said: It is a complete freedom (from Ihram).",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
3010,Ibn 'Abbas (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ) 'is reported to have said:,"The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) put on Ihigm for Hajj.

3014,Ibn 'Abbas (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہما) reported:,"Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) as saying: This is the 'Umra of which we have taken advantage.

3020,Ata' said:,"Ibn 'Abbas (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ) used to say that a pilgrim or non-pilgrim (one performing 'Umar) who circumambulates the House is free from the responsibility of Ihram. I (Ibn Juraij, one of the narrators) said to 'Ata': On what authority does he (Ibn Abbas رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ ) say this? He said: On the authority uf Allah's words: Then their place of sacrifice is the Ancient House (al-Qur'an, xxii. 33). I said: It concerns the time after staying at 'Arafat, whereupon he said: Ibn 'Abbas (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ) had stated (that the place of sacrifice is the Ancient House) ; it way be after staying at 'Arafat or before (staying there).
