2481,Abdul-Muttalib bin Rabi'a bin al-Harith reported that Rabi'a bin al-Harith and Abbas bin Abdul-Muttalib رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ gathered together and said:,"By Allah, if we had sent these two young boys (i. e. I and Fadl bin 'Abbas رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ ) to the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and they had spoken to him, he would have appointed them (as the collectors) of these sadaqat; and they would (collect them) and pay (to the Holy Prophet) as other people (collectors) paid and would get a share as other people got it. As they were talking about it there came 'Ali bin Abu Talib رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ and stood before them, and they made a mention of it to him. 'Ali bin Abu Talib رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ said: Don't do that; by Allah he (the Holy Prophet) would not do that (would not accept your request). Rabi'a bin Harith رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ turned to him and said: By Allah, you are not doing so but out of jealousy that you nurse against us By Allah, you became the son-in-law of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) but we felt no jealousy against you (for this great privilege of yours). 'Ali رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ then said: Send them (if you like). They set out and 'Ali رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ lay on the bed.

He took hold of our ears (out of love and affection) and then said: Give out what you have kept in your hearts. He then entered (the apartment) and we also went in and he (the Holy Prophet) was on that day (in the house of) Zainab bin jahsh رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ . We urged each (of us) to speak. Then one of us thus spoke: Messenger of Allah, you are the best of humanity and the best to cement the ties of blood-relations. We have reached the-marriageable age. We have come (to you) so that you may appoint us (as collectors) of these sadaqat. and we would pay you just as thin people (other collectors) pay you, and get our share as others get it. He (the Holy Prophet) kept silence for a long time till we wished that we should speak with him (again), and Zainab رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہا pointied to us from behind the curtain not to talk (any more). He (the Holy Prophet) said; It does not become the family of Muhammad (to accept) sadaqat for they are the impurities of people. You call to me Mahmiya (and he was in charge of khums, i. e, of the one-fifth part that goes to the treasury out of the spoils of war), and Naufal bin Harith bin 'Abdul-Muttalib.
