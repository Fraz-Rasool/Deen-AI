6401,"Ubaidullah bin Rafi', who was the scribe of 'Ali رضی اللہ عنہ, reported:","I heard 'Ali ( رضی اللہ عنہ) as saying: Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) sent me and Zubair and Miqdad رضی اللہ عنہ saying: Go to the garden of, Khakh [it is a place between Medina and Mecca at a distance of twelve miles from Medina] and there you will find a woman riding a camel. She would be in possession of a letter, which you must get from her. So we rushed on horses and when we met that woman, we asked her to deliver that letter to us. She said: There is no letter with me. We said: Either bring out that letter or we would take off your clothes. She brought out that letter from (the plaited hair of) her head. We delivered that letter to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) in which Hatib bin Abu Balta'a had informed some people amongst the polytheists of Mecca about the affairs of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Hatib, what is this? He said: Allah's messenger, do not be hasty in judging my intention. I was a person attached to the Quraish. Sufyan said: He was their ally but had no relationship with them. (Hatib further said): Those who are with you amongst the emigrants have blood-relationship with them (the Quraish) and thus they would protect their families. I wished that when I had no blood-relationship with them I should find some supporters from (amongst them) who would help my family. I have not done this because of any unbelief or apostasy and I have no liking for the unbelief after I have (accepted) Islam. Thereupon Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: You have told the truth. 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said: Allah's Messenger, permit me to strike the neck of this hypocrite. But he (the Holy Prophet) said: He was a participant in Badr and you little know that Allah revealed about the people of Badr: Do what you like for there is forgiveness for you. And Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said: O you who believe, do not take My enemy and your enemy for friends (lx. 1). And there is no mention of this verse in the hadith transmitted on the authority of Abu Bakr and Zubair and Ishaq has in his narration made a mention of the recitation of this verse by Sufyan.",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
6402,Ali رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) sent me and Abu Marthad al-Ghitnavi and Zubair bin 'Awwam رضی اللہ عنہ and we were all riders, and he said: Ride on until you reach the garden of Khakh for there is a woman amongst the polytheists and there is a letter with her sent by Hatib to the polytheists and he mention a Hadith like that of Ubaidullah bin Abi Rafi from Ali رضی اللہ عنہ.",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
6403,Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,A slave of Hatib رضی اللہ عنہ came to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) complaining against Hatib رضی اللہ عنہ and said: Hatib رضی اللہ عنہ will definitely go to Hell. (But) Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: You tell a lie; he would not get into that for he had taken part in Badr and in (the expedition of) Hudaibiya.,The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
6404,Umm Mubashshir رضی اللہ عنہا reported:,"She heard Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) as saying in presence of Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا : God willing, the people of the Tree would never enter the fire of Hell one amongst those who owed allegiance under that. She said: Allah's Messenger, why not? He scolded her. Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا said: And there is none amongst you but shall have to pass over that (narrow Bridge). Thereupon Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has said: We would rescue those persons who are God-conscious and we would leave the tyrants to their fate there (xix. 72).",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
6405,Abu Musa رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"I was in the company of Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) as he had been sitting in Ji'rana (a place) between Mecca and Medina and Bilal رضی اللہ عنہ was also there, that there came to Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) a desert Arab, and he said: Muhammad, fulfill your promise that you made with me. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said to him: Accept glad tidings. Thereupon the desert Arab said: You shower glad tidings upon me very much; then Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) turned towards Abu Musa and Bilal رضی اللہ عنہ seemingly in a state of annoyance and said: Verily he has rejected glad tidings but you two should accept them. We said: Allah's Messenger, we have readily accepted them. Then Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) called for a cup of water and washed his hands in that and face too and put the saliva in it and then said: Drink out of it and pour it over your faces and over your chest and gladden yourselves. They took hold of the cup and did as Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had commanded them to do. Thereupon Umm Salama رضی اللہ عنہا called from behind the veil: Spare some water in your vessel for your mother also, and they also gave some water which had been spared for her.",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
6406,Abu Burda reported on the authority of his father:,"When Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had been free from the Battle of Hunain, he sent Abu 'Amir as the head of the army of Autas. He had an encounter with Duraid bin as_Simma. Duraid was killed and Allah gave defeat to his friends. Abu Musa said: He (the Holy Prophet) sent me along with Abu 'Amir and Abu 'Amir رضی اللہ عنہ received a wound in his knee from the arrow, (shot by) a person of Bani Jusham. It stuck in his knee. I went to him and said: Uncle, who shot an arrow upon you? Abu 'Amir رضی اللہ عنہ pointed out to Abu Musa رضی اللہ عنہ and said: Verily that one who shot an arrow upon me in fact killed me. Abu Musa رضی اللہ عنہ said: I followed him with the determination to kill him and overtook him and when he saw me he turned upon his heels. I followed him and I said to him: Don't you feel ashamed (that you run), aren't you an Arab? Why don't you stop? He stopped and I had an encounter with him and we exchanged the strokes of (swords). I struck him with the sword and killed him. Then I came back to Abu Amir رضی اللہ عنہ and said: Verily Allah has killed the one who killed you. And he said: Now draw out this arrow. I drew out the arrow and there came out from that (wound) water. Abu 'Amir رضی اللہ عنہ said: My nephew, go to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and convey my greetings to him and tell him that Abu Amir رضی اللہ عنہ begs you to ask forgiveness for him. And Abu Amir appointed me as the chief of the people and he died after a short time. When I came to Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) I visited him and he had been lying on the cot woven by strings and there was (no) bed over it and so there had been marks of the strings on the back of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and on his sides. I narrated to him what had happened to us and narrated to him about Abu Amir and said to him that he had made a request to the effect that forgiveness should be sought for him (from Allah). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called for water and performed ablution with it. He then lifted his hands and said. O Allah, grant pardon to Thy servant Abu Amir. (The Prophet had raised his hands so high for supplication) that I saw the whiteness of his armpits. He again said: O Allah, grant him distinction amongst the majority of Thine created beings or from amongst the people. I said: Allah's Messenger, ask forgiveness for me too. Thereupon Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Allah, forgive the sins of Abdullah bin Qais (Abu Musa Ash'ari) and admit him to an elevated place on the Day of Resurrection. Abu Burda رضی اللہ عنہ said: One prayer is for abu 'Amir and the other is tor Abu Musa.",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
6407,Abu Musa رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: I recognise the voice of the Ash'arites while they recite the Qur'an as they arrive during the night and I also recognise their station from the recital of the Qur'an during the night time, although I have not seen their encampments as they encamp during the day time. And there is a person amongst them, Hakim; when he encounters the horsemen or the enemies he says to them: My friends command you to wait for them.",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
6408,Abu Musa رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: When the Ash'arites run short of provisions in the campaigns or run short of food for their children in Medina they collect whatever is with them in the cloth and then partake equally from one vessel. They are from me and I am from them.,The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
6409,Ibn Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"The Muslims neither looked to Abu Sufyan رضی اللہ عنہ (with respect) nor did they sit in his company. he (Abu Sufyan) said to Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ): Allah's Apostle, confer upon me three things. He replied in the affirmative. He (further) said: I have with me the most handsome and the best (woman) Umm Habiba رضی اللہ عنہا , daughter of Abu Sufyan; marry her, whereupon he said: Yes. And he again said: Accept Mu'awiya to serve as your scribe. He said: Yes. He again said: Make me the commander (of the Muslim army) so that I should fight against the unbelievers as I fought against the Muslims. He said: Yes. Abu Zumnail said: If he had not asked for these three things from Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ), he would have never conferred them upon him, for it was (his habit) to accede to everybody's (earnest) request",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
6410,Abu Musa رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"We were in Yemen when we heard of the migration of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). We also set out as immigrants to him. And I was accompanied by two brothers of mine, I being the youngest of them; one of them was Abu Burda and the other one was Abu Ruhm, and there were some other persons with them. Some say they were fifty-three or fifty-two persons of my tribe. We embarked upon a boat, and the boat sailed away to the Negus of Abyssinia. There we met Ja'far bin Abu Talib رضی اللہ عنہ and his companions. Ja'far رضی اللہ عنہ said: Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) has sent us here and has commanded us to stay here and you should also stay with us. So we stayed with him and we came back (to Medina) and met Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) when Khaibar had been conquered. He (the Holy Prophet) allocated a share to us and in the ordinary course he did not allocate the share to one who had been absent on the occasion of the conquest of Khaibar but conferred (a share) upon him only who had been present there with him. He, however, made an exception for the people of the boat, viz. for Ja'far رضی اللہ عنہ and his companions. He allocated a share to them, and some persons from amongst the people said to us, viz. the people of the boat: We have preceded you in migration.",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
6411,,"Asma' bint 'Umais رضی اللہ عنہا who had migrated to Abyssinia and had come back along with them (along with immigrants) visited Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا , the wife of Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). (Accordingly), Umarv رضی اللہ عنہ had been sitting with her (Hafsa). As 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ saw Asma رضی اللہ عنہا, he said: Who is she? She (Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا ) said: She is Asma, daughter of 'Umais. He said: She is an Abyssinian and a sea-woman. Asma رضی اللہ عنہا said: Yes, it is so. Thereupon 'Umar said: We preceded you in migration and so we have more right to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) as compared with you. At this she felt annoyed and said: 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ, you are not stating the fact; by Allah, you had the privilege of being in the company of the Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) who fed the hungry among you and instructed the ignorant amongst you, whereas we had been far (from here) in the land of Abyssinia amongst the enemies and that was all for Allah and Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and, by Allah, I would never take food nor take water unless I make a mention to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) of what you have said. We remained in that country in constant trouble and dread and I shall talk about it to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and ask him (about it). By Allah, I shall not tell a lie and deviate (from the truth) and add anything to that. So, when Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) came, she said: Allah's Apostle, 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہا says so and so. Upon this Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: His right is not more than yours, for him and his companions there is one migration, but for you, i.e. for the people of the boat, there are two migrations. She said: I saw Abu Musa رضی اللہ عنہ and the people of the boat coming to me in groups and asking me about this hadith, because there was nothing more pleasing and more significant for them than this. Abu Burda reported that Asma رضی اللہ عنہا said: I saw Abu Musa رضی اللہ عنہ, asking me to repeat this hadith to him again and again.",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
6412,A'idh bin Amr رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"Abu Sufyan رضی اللہ عنہ came to Salman, Suhaib and Bilal in the presence of a group of persons. They said: By Allah, the sword of Allah did not reach the neck of the enemy of Allah as it was required to reach. Thereupon Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ said: Do you say this to the old man of the Quraish and their chief? Then he came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and informed him of this. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) said: Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ, you have perhaps annoyed them and if you annoyed them you have in fact annoyed your Lord. So Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ came to them and said: O my brothers, I have annoyed you. They said: No, our brother, may Allah forgive you",The Book of the Merits of the Companions,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
6413,Jabir bin Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"It was concerning them (the Ansar) that this verse was revealed, that when the two groups amongst you were about to lose heart and Allah was the Guardian of them both.
