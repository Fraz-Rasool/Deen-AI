He also said on the Day of Victory over Mecca: Allah made this town sacred on the day He created the earth and the heavens; so it is -sacred by the sacred- ness conferred on it by Allah until the Day of Resurrection and fighting in it was not lawful to anyone before me, and it was made lawful for me only during an hour on one day, for it is sacred by the sacredness conferred on it by Allah until the Day of Resurrection. Its thorns are not to be cut, its game is not to be molested, and the things dropped are to be picked up only by one who makes a public announcement of it, and its fresh herbage is not to be cut. Abbas ( رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ) said: Messenger of Allah, exception may be made in case of rush, for it is useful for their blacksmiths and for their houses.

3304,Abu Shuraih al-'Adawi رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ reported:,"He said to Amr bin Sa'id when he was sending troops to Mecca: Let me tell you something. O Commander, which Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said on the day following, the Conquest which my ears heard and my heart has retained, and my eyes saw as he spoke it. He praised Allah and extolled Him and then said: Allah, not men, has made Mecca sacred; so it is not permissible for any person believing in Allah and the Last Day to shed blood in it, or lop a tree in it. If anyone seeks a concession on the basis of fighting of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ), tell him that Allah permitted His Messenger, but not you, and He gave him permission only for an hour on one day, and its sacredness was restored on the very day like that of yesterday. Let him who is present convey the information to him who is absent. It was said to Abu Shuraih رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ : What did Amr say to you? He said: I am better informed of that than you, Abu Shuraih رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ, but the sacred territory does not grant protection to one who is disobedient, or one who runs away after shedding blood, or one who runs away after committing.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
3305,"Abu Huraira, (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ) reported:","When Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, granted Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) victory over Mecca, he stood before people and praised and extolled Allah and then said: Verily Allah held back the elephants from Mecca and gave the domination of it to His Messenger and believers, and it (this territory) was not violable to anyone before me and it was made violable to me for an hour of a day, and it shall not be violable to anyone after me. So neither molest the game, nor weed out thorns from it. And it is not lawful for anyone to pick up a thing dropped but one who makes public announcement of it. And it a relative of anyone is killed he is entitled to opt for one of two things. Either he should be paid blood-money or he can take life as (a just retribution). 'Abbas (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ) said: Allah's Messenger, but Idhkhir (a kind of herbage), for we use it for our graves and for our houses, whereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: With the exception of Idhkhir. A person known as Abu Shah, one of the people of Yemen, stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, (kindly) write it for me. Thereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said I Write it for Abu Shah. Walid said: I asked al-Auzai': What did his saying mean: Write it for me, Messenger of Allah ? He said: This very address that he had heard from Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ).",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih
3306,Abu Huraira (رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ) reported:,"The people of the Khuza'ah tribe killed a man of the tribe of Laith in the Year of Victory as a retaliation for one whom they had killed (whom the people of the tribe of Laith had killed). It was reported to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). He mounted his camel and delivered this address: Verily Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, held back the Elephants from Mecca, and gave its domination to His Messenger and believers. Behold, it was not violable for anyone before me and it will not be violable for anyone after me. Behold, it was made violable for me for an hour of a day; and at this very hour it has again been made inviolable (for me as well as for others). So its thorns are not to be cut, its trees are not to be lopped, and (no one is allowed to) pick up a thing dropped, but the one who makes an announcement of it. And one whose fellow is killed is allowed to opt between two alternatives: either he should receive blood-money or get the life of the (murderer) in return. He (the narrator said): A person from the Yemen, who was called Abu Shah, came to him and said: Messenger of Allah, write it down for me, whereupon he (Allah's Messenger) said: Write it down for Abu Shah. One of the persons from among the Quraish also said: Except Idhkhir, for we use it in our houses ant our graves.
