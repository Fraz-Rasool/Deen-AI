3500,Anas (رضی اللہ عنہ ) reported:,"I was sitting behind Abu Talha رضی اللہ عنہ on the Day of Khaibar and my feet touched the foot of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌), and we came (to the people of Khaibar) when the sun had risen and they had driven out their cattle, and had themselves come out with their axes, large baskets and hatchets, and they said: (Here come) Muhammad and the army. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: Khaibar is ruined. Verily when we get down in the valley of a people, evil is the morning of the warned ones (al-Qur'an, xxxvii. 177). Allah, the Majestic and the Glorious, defeated them (the inhabitants of Khaibar), and there fell to the lot of Dihya a beautiful girl, and Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) got her in exchange of seven heads, and then entrusted her to Umm Sulaim so that she might embellish her and prepare her (for marriage) with him. He (the narrator) said: He had been under the impression that he had said that so that she might spend her period of 'Iddah in her (Umm Sulaim's) house. (The woman) was Safiyya daughter of Huyayy. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) arranged the wedding feast consisting of dates, cheese, and refined butter, and pits were dug and tiers were set in them dining cloths, and there was brought cheese and refined butter, and these were placed there. And the people ate to their fill, and they said: We do not know whether he (the Holy Prophet) had married her (as a free woman), or as a slave woman. They said: If he (the Holy Prophet) would make her wear the veil, then she would be a (free married) woman, and if he would not make her wear the veil, then she should be a slave woman. When he intended to ride, he made her wear the veil and she sat on the hind part of the camel; so they came to know that he had married her. As they approached Medina, Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) drove (his ride) quickly and so we did. 'Adba' (the name of Allah's Apostle's camel) stumbled and Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) fell down and she (Radrat Safiyya: also fell down. He (the Holy Prophet) stood up and covered her. Women looked towards her and said: May Allah keep away the Jewess! He (the narrator) said: I said: Aba Hamza, did Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) really fall down? He said: Yes, by Allah, he in fact fell down.",The Book of Marriage,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih
3501,"Anas, (رضی اللہ عنہ) reported:","Safiyya (رضی اللہ عنہا) fell to the lot of Dihya رضی اللہ عنہا in the spoils of war, and they praised her in the presence of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and said: We have not seen the like of her among the captives of war. He sent (a messenger) to Dihya رضی اللہ عنہا and he gave him whatever he demanded. He then sent her to my mother and asked her to embellish her. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) then got out of Khaibar until when he was on the other side of it, he halted, and a tent was pitched for him. When it was morning Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: He who has surplus of provision with him should bring that to us. Some persons would bring the surplus of dates, and the other surplus of mush of barley until there became a heap of bals. They began to eat the hais and began to drink out of the pond which had the water of rainfall in it and which was situated by their side. Anas رضی اللہ عنہ said that that constituted the wedding feast of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). He (further) said: We proceeded until we saw the walls of Medina, and we were delighted. We made our mounts run quickly and Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) also made his mount run quickly. And Safiyya (رضی اللہ عنہا) was at his back, and Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had seated her behind him. The camel of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) stumbled and he (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) fell down and she also fell down. And none among the people was seeing him and her, until Allah's Messeuger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) stood up and he covered her, and we came to him and he said: We have received no injury. We entered Medina and there came out the young ladies of the household. They saw her (hadrat Safiyya رضی اللہ عنہا) and blamed her for falling down.",The Book of Marriage,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih
3502,Anas ( رضی اللہ عنہ) reported:,"When the 'Iddah of Zainab رضی اللہ عنہا was over, Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said to Zaid to make a mention to her about him. Zaid رضی اللہ عنہ went on until he came to her and she was fermenting her flour. He (Zaid) said: As I saw her I felt in my heart an idea of her greatness so much so that I could not see towards her (simply for the fact) that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) had made a mention of her. So I turned my back towards her. and I turned upon my heels, and said: Zainab, Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) has sent (me) with a message to you. She said: I do not do anything until I solicit the will of my Lord. So she stood at her place of worship and the (verse of) the Qur'an (pertaining to her marriage) were revealed, and Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) came to her without permission. He (the narrator) said: I saw that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) served us bread and meat until it was broad day light and the people went away, but some persons who were busy in con- versation stayed on in the house after the meal. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) also went out and I also followed him, and he began to visit the apartments of his wives greeting them (with the words): As-Salamu 'alaikum, and they would say: Allah's Messenger ﷺ, how did you find your family (hadrat Zainab رضی اللہ عنہا)? He (the narrator) stated: I do not know whether I had informed him that the people had gone out or he (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) informed me (about that). He moved on until he entered the apartment, and I also went and wanted to enter (the apartment) along with him, but he threw a curtain between me and him, as (the verfes pertaining to seclusion) had been revealed, and people were instructed in what they had been instructed. Ibn Rafii had made this addition in his narration: O you who believe, enter not the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to you for a meal, not waiting for its cooking being finished... to the words ... Allah forbears not from the truth.",The Book of Marriage,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih
3503,Anas (رضی اللہ عنہ) reported:,"I did not see Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) giving a wedding feast (on the marriage) of any one (of his wives) as he did in the case of (his marriage with) Zainab, for then he sacrificed a goat (on this occasion).",The Book of Marriage,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih
3504,Anas bin Malik ( رضی اللہ عنہ) reported:,Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ) gave no better wedding feast than the one he did (on the occasion of his marriage with) Zainab رضی اللہ عنہا. Thabit al-Bunani (one of the narrators) said: What did he serve in the wedding feast? He (Anas رضی اللہ عنہ) said: He fed them bread and meat (so lavishly) that they (the guests) abandoned it (of their own accord after having taken them to their hearts' content).,The Book of Marriage,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih
3505,Anas bin Malik ( رضی اللہ عنہ) reported:,"When Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) married Zainab bint jahsh رضی اللہ عنہا , he invited people (to the wedding feast) and they ate food. They then sat there and entered into conversation. He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) made a stir as if he was preparing to stand up, but (the persons busy in talking) did not stand up. When he (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) saw it, he stood up and when he did so, some other persons stood up. 'Asim and Abdul-A'la in their narrations made this addition: Three (persons) sat there, and Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم) came there to enter (the apartment) but he found the people sitting there. Then they stood up and went away. He said: Then I came and informed Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) that they had gone away. He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) then came there until he entered (the apartment). I also went and was about to enter, when he hung a curtain between me and him (and it was on this occasion that) Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed this verse: O you who believe, enter not the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to you for a meal, not waiting for its cooking being finished to the (words) Surely this is serious in the sight of Allah (xxxiii. 53).",The Book of Marriage,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih
3506,Anas bin Malik (رضی اللہ عنہ) reported:,"I was the best informed among the people pertaining to Hijab (veil and seclusion). Ubayy bin Ka'b رضی اللہ عنہ used to ask me about it. Anas (رضی اللہ عنہ) thus narrated: The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) got up in the morning as a bridegroom of Zainab bint jahsh ( رضی اللہ عنہا) as he had married her at Medina. He invited people to the wedding feast after the day had well risen. There sat Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and there kept sitting along with him some persons after the people had stood up (for departure); then Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) stood up and walked on and I also walked along with him until he reached the door of the apartment of 'A'isha (رضی اللہ عنہا). He then thought that they (those who had been sitting there after meal) had gone away. So he returned and I also returned with him, but they were still sitting at their places. So he returned for the second time and I also returned until he reached the apartment of 'A'isha رضی اللہ عنہا. He again returned and I also returned and they had (by that time) stood up, and he hung a curtain between me and him (at the door of the apartment of Hadrat Zainab رضی اللہ عنہا, where he had to stay), and Allah revealed the verse pertaining to veil.",The Book of Marriage,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih
3507,Anas bin Malik ( رضی اللہ عنہ) reported:,"Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) contracted marriage and he went to his wife. My mother Umm Sulaim رضی اللہ عنہا prepared hais and placed it in an earthen vessel and said: Anas رضی اللہ عنہا , take it to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and say: My mother has sent that to you and she offers greetings to you, and says that it is a humble gift for you on our behalf, Messenger of Allah ﷺ. So I went along with it to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ) and said: My mother offers you salutations, and says that it is a humble gift for you on our behalf. He said: Place it here, and then said: Go and invite on my behalf so and so and anyone whom you meet, and he even named some persons. He (Anas رضی اللہ عنہ) said: I invited whom he had named and whom I met. I (one of the narrators) said: I said to Anas رضی اللہ عنہ: How many (persons) were there? He (Anas رضی اللہ عنہ) said: They were about three hundred persons. Then Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) (said to me): Anas رضی اللہ عنہ, bring that earthen vessel. They (the guests) then began to enter until the courtyard and the apartment were fully packed. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: Make a circle of ten (guests), and every person should eat from that nearest to him. They began to eat, until they ate to their fill. A group went out (after eating the food), and another group came in until all of them had eaten. He (the Holy Prophet) said to me: Anas رضی اللہ عنہ, lift it (the earthen vessel), so I lifted it, but I could not assess whether it had more (food) when I placed it (before Allah's Messenger) or when I lifted it (after the people had been served out of it). A group among them (the guests) began to talk in the house of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) was sitting and his wife had been sitting with her face turned towards the wall. It was troublesome for Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌), so Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) went out and greeted his wives. He then returned. When they (the guests) saw that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) had returned they thought that it (their overstay) was something troublesome for him. He (the narrator) said: They hastened towards the door and all of them went out. And there came Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and he hung a curtain and went in, and I was sitting in his apartment and he did not stay but for a short while. He then came to me and these verses were revealed. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) came out and recited them to the people: O you who believe, enter not the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to you for a meal, not waiting for its cooking being finished-but when you are invited, enter, and when you have taken food, disperse not seeking to listen to talk. Surely this gives the Prophet trouble , to the end of verse (xxxiii. 53). (Al-Ja'd said that Anas bin Malik رضی اللہ عنہ] stated: I am the first amongst the people to hear these verses), and henceforth the wives of the Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ) began to observe seclusion (al-hijab).",The Book of Marriage,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih
3508,Anas (رضی اللہ عنہ) reported:,"When Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) contracted marriage with Zainab (رضی اللہ عنہا), Umm Sulaim رضی اللہ عنہا sent him hats in a vessel of stone as a gift. Anas رضی اللہ عنہ stated that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said to him: Go and invite on my behalf all the Muslims whom you meet. So I invited on his behalf everyone whom I met. They entered (his house) and they ate and went out. And Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had kept his hand on the food, and he invoked blessing on that, and said whatever Allah wished him to say, and none whom I met was left uninvited. They ate to their fill and went out, but a group among them remained there and was engaged in lengthy discussion. Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) felt shy of saying them anything. So he went out and left them in his house and Allah the Great and Majestic revealed this verse: 0 you who believe, enter not the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to you for a meal, not waiting for its cooking being finished. Qatada (instead of using the word Ghaira Nazirina) used the word Ghaira Mutahayyinina (i. e. not waiting for the time of the food). But when you are invited, enter... up to this verse. This is purer for your hearts and their hearts.",The Book of Marriage,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih
