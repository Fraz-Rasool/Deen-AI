One who had come from Hadramaut said: Messenger of Allah, only this man has appropriated my land which belonged to my father. The one who had came from Kinda contended. This is my land and is in my possession: I cultivate it. There is no right for him in it. The Messenger of Allah said to the Hadramite: Have you any evidence (to support you)? He replied in the negative. He (the Messenger of Allah) said: Then your case is to be decided on his oath. He (the Hadramite) said: Messenger of Allah, he is a liar and cares not what he swears and has no regard for anything.

'Iban He (the Holy Prophet) said (to the claimant): Have you evidence (to substantiate your claim)? He replied: I have no evidence.

(At this juncture) Ma'qil said: I am going to narrate to you a hadith which I have heard from the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and which I would not have transmitted if I knew that I would survive. Verily I have heard the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) say: There is none amongst the bondsmen who was entrusted with the affairs of his subjects and he died in such a state that he was dishonest in his dealings with those over whom he ruled that the Paradise is not forbidden for him.,The Book of Faith,Sahih Muslim,1,Sahih

Verily the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) observed: Allah does not entrust to his bondsman the responsibility of managing the affairs of his subjects and he dies as a dishonest (ruler) but Paradise is forbidden by Allah for such a (ruler). He (Ibn Ziyad) said: Why did you not narrate it to me before this day?

Ma'qil رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ said to him: I am narrating to you a hadith which I would have never narrated to you had I not been in death-bed. I heard Allah's apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) say: A ruler who has been entrusted with the affairs of the Muslims but he makes no endeavors ( for the material and moral uplift) and does not sincerely mean (their welfare) would not enter Paradise along with them.,The Book of Faith,Sahih Muslim,1,Sahih
367,Hudhaifa رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ reported:,"The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) narrated to us two ahadith. I have seen one (crystallized into reality), and I am waiting for the other. He told us: Trustworthiness descended in the innermost (root) of the hearts of people. Then the Qur'an was revealed and they learnt from the Qur'an and they learnt from the Sunnah. Then he (the Holy Prophet) told us about the removal of trustworthiness. He said: The man would have a wink of sleep and trustworthiness would be taken away from his heart leaving the impression of a faint mark. He would again sleep and trustworthiness would be taken away from his heart leaving an impression of a blister, as if you rolled down an ember on your foot and it was vesicled. He would see a swelling having nothing in it. He (the Holy Prophet) then took up a pebble and rolled it down over his foot and (said): The people would enter into transactions amongst one another and hardly a person would be left who would return (things) entrusted to him. (And there would be so much paucity of honest persons) till it would be said: There in such a such tribe is a trustworthy man. And they would also say about a person: How prudent he is, how broad-minded he is and how intelligent he is, whereas in his heart there would not be faith even to the weight of a mustard seed. I have passed through a time in which I did not care with whom amongst you I entered into a transaction, for if he were a Muslim his faith would compel him to discharge his obligations to me and it he were a Christian or a Jew, the ruler would compel him to discharge his obligations to me. But today I would not enter into a transaction with you except so and so.",The Book of Faith,Sahih Muslim,1,Sahih

Some people said: It is we who heard it. Upon this be remarked: Perhaps by turmoil you presume the unrest of man in regard to his household or neighbour, they replied: Yes. He ('Umar ‌رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ ) observed: Such (an unrest) would be done away with by prayer, fasting and charity. But who amongst you has heard from the Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) describing that turmoil which would come like the wave of the ocean. Hudhaifa said: The people hushed into silence, I replied: It is I. He ('Umar ‌رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ ) said: Ye, well, your father was also very pious. Hudhaifa ‌رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ ‌said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be, upon him ) observing: Temptations will be presented to men's hearts as reed mat is woven stick by stick and any heart which is impregnated by them will have a black mark put into it, but any heart which rejects them will have a white mark put in it. The result is that there will become two types of hearts: one white like a white stone which will not be harmed by any turmoil or temptation, so long as the heavens and the earth endure; and the other black and dust-coloured like a vessel which is upset, not recognizing what is good or rejecting what is abominable, but being impregnated with passion. Hudhaifa ‌رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ said: I narrated to him ('Umar ‌رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ ): There is between you and that (turmoil) a closed door, but there is every likelihood of its being broken. 'Umar ‌رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ said: Would it be broken? You have, been rendered fatherless. Had it been opened, it would have been perhaps closed also. I said: No, it would be broken, and I narrated to him: Verily that door implies a person who would be killed or die. There is no mistake in this hadith. Abu Khalid narrated: I said to Sa'd, O Abu Malik, what do you mean by the term Aswad Murbadda ? He replied: High degree of whiteness in blackness. I said: What is meant by Alkoozu Mujakhiyyan ? He replied: A vessel turned upside down.",The Book of Faith,Sahih Muslim,1,Sahih

371,It is transmitted by Rib'i bin Hirash. who narrated it on the authority of Hudhaifa ‌رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ ‌:,"Verily 'Umar ‌رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ said: Who would narrate to us or who amongst you would narrate to us (and Hudhaifa was one amongst them) what the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had said about the turmoil? Hudhaifa said: I will, and recited the hadith like that transmitted by Abu Malik on the authority of Rib'i and he observed in connection with this hadith that Hudhaifa ‌رضی ‌اللہ ‌عنہ remarked: I am narrating to you a hadith and it has no mistake, and said: That it is transmitted from he Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ).",The Book of Faith,Sahih Muslim,1,Sahih
