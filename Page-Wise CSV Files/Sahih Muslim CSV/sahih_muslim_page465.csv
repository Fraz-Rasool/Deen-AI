Then Huwayyisa spoke and then Muhayyisa also spoke. Thereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: They should either pay blood-wit for your companion, or be prepared for war. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) wrote about it to them (to the Jews). They wrote: Verily, by Allah, we have not killed him.

They said: No. He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) said: Then the Jews will take oath (of their innocence). They said: They are not Muslims.
