He said: I have experienced from thy people and the hardest treatment I met from them was what I received from them on the day of `Aqaba. I betook myself to Ibn `Abd Yalil b. `Abd Kulal with the purpose of inviting him to Islam, but he did not respond to me as I desired. So I departed with signs of (deep) distress on my face. I did not recover until I reached Qarn al-Tha`alib. Where I raised my head, lo! near me was a cloud which had cast its shadow on me. I looked and lo! there was in it the angel Jibril who called out to me and said: God, the Honored and Glorious, has heard what thy people have said to thee, and how they have reacted to thy call. And He has sent to thee the angel in charge of the mountains so that thou mayest order him what thou wishest (him to do) with regard to them. The angel in charge of the mountains (then) called out to me, greeted me and said: Muhammad, God has listened to what thy people have said to thee. I am the angel in charge of the mountains, and thy Lord has sent me to thee so that thou mayest order me what thou wishest. If thou wishest that I should bring together the two mountains that stand opposite to each other at the extremities of Mecca to crush them in between, (I would do that). But the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) said to him: I rather hope that God will produce from their descendants such persons as will worship Allah, the One, and will not ascribe partners to Him.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih

4659,It has been narrated on the authority of Usama bin Zaid رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Prophet (ﷺ) rode a donkey. It had on it a saddle under which was a mattress made at Fadak (a place near Medina). Behind him he seated Usama. He was going to the street of Banu Harith al-Khazraj to inquire after the health of Sa'd bin Ubada رضی اللہ عنہThis happened before the Battle of Badr. (He proceeded) until he passed by a mixed company of people in which were Muslims, polytheists, idol worshippers and the Jews and among them were 'Abdullah bin Ubayy and 'Abdullah bin Rawaha رضی اللہ عنہ. When the dust raised by the hoofs of the animal spread over the company, 'Abdullah bin Ubayy covered his nose with his mantle and said: Do not scatter the dust over us (Not minding this remark), the Prophet (ﷺ) greeted them, stopped, got down from his animal, invited them to Allah, and recited to them the Qur'an. 'Abdullah bin Ubayy said: O man, if what you say is the truth, the best thing for you would be not to bother us with it in our assemblies. Get back to your place. Whoso comes to you from us, tell him (all) this. Abdullah bin Rawaha رضی اللہ عنہ said: Come to us in our gatherings, for we love (to hear) it. The narrator says: (At this), the Muslims, the polytheists and the Jews began to rebuke one another until they were determined to come to blows. The Prophet (ﷺ) continued to pacify them. (When they were pacified), he rode his animal and came to Sa'd bin 'Ubida رضی اللہ عنہ . He said: Sa'd, haven't you heard what Abu Hubab (meaning 'Abdullah bin Ubayy) has said? He has said so and so. Sa'd رضی اللہ عنہ said: Messenger of Allah, forgive and pardon. God has granted you a sublime position, (but so far as he is concerned) the people of this settlement had-decided to make him their king by making him wear a crown and a turban (in token thereof), but God has circumvented this by the truth He has granted you. This has made him jealous and his jealousy (must have) prompted the behaviour that you have witnessed. So, the Prophet (may peace upon him) forgave him.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4660,A similar tradition has been narrated through a different chain of transmitters by Ibn Shihab with the addition of the words:,Before Abdullah (bin Ubayy) became a Muslim.,The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4661,It has been narrated on the authority of Anas bin Malik رضی اللہ عنہ :,"It was said to the Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌): Would that you approached Abdullah bin Ubayy (to persuade him to accept Islam). The Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) (accordingly) went to him, riding a donkey, and (a party of) Muslims also went (with him). On the way they had to walk over a piece of land affected with salinity. When the Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) approached him, he said: Do not come near me. By Allah, the obnoxious smell of your donkey has offended me. (As a rejoinder to this remark), a man from the Ansar said: By God, the smell of the donkey of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) is better than your smell. (At this), a man from the tribe of 'Abdullah got furious. Then people from both sides got furious and exchanged blows with sticks, hands and shoes. (The narrator says) that (after this scuffle) we learnt that (the Qur'anic verse): It two parties of the Believers have a quarrel, make ye peace between them (xlix. 9) was revealed about these fighting parties.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih

Ibn Mas'ud رضی اللہ عنہ went (to gather this information). He found that the two sons of 'Afra' had struck him and he lay cold at the point of death. He caught him by his beard and said: Art thou Abu Jahl? He said: is there anybody superior to the person you have killed, or (he said) his people have killed him. Ibn Mas'ud رضی اللہ عنہ says that, according to Abu Mijlaz, Abu Jahl said: Alas! a person other than a farmer would have killed me.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4663,Anas رضی اللہ عنہ said:,"""The prophet of Allah ﷺ said: 'Who will find out for me what happen to Abu Jahl?''' A Hadith like that of Ibn 'Ulayyah, (no. 4662) and the word of Abu Mijlaz as narrated by Ismail.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4664,It has been narrated on the authority of Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Who will kill Ka'b bin Ashraf? He has maligned Allah, the Exalted, and His Messenger. Muhammad bin Maslama رضی اللہ عنہ said: Messenger of Allah, do you wish that I should kill him? He said: Yes. He said: Permit me to talk (to him in the way I deem fit). He said: Talk (as you like). So, Muhammad bin Maslama رضی اللہ عنہ came to Ka'b and talked to him, referred to the old friendship between them and said: This man (i.e. the Holy Prophet) has made up his mind to collect charity (from us) and this has put us to a great hardship. When be heard this, Ka'b said: By God, you will be put to more trouble by him. Muhammad bin Maslama said: No doubt, now we have become his followers and we do not like to forsake him until we see what turn his affairs will take. I want that you should give me a loan. He said: What will you mortgage? He said: What do you want? He said: Pledge me your women. He said: You are the most handsome of the Arabs; should we pledge our women to you? He said: Pledge me your children. He said: The son of one of us may abuse us saying that he was pledged for two wasqs of dates, but we can pledge you (cur) weapons. He said: All right. Then Muhammad bin Maslama promised that he would come to him with Harith, Abu 'Abs bin Jabr and Abbad bin Bishr. So they came and called upon him at night. He came down to them. Sufyan says that all the narrators except 'Amr have stated that his wife said: I hear a voice which sounds like the voice of murder. He said: It is only Muhammad bin Maslama and his foster-brother, Abu Na'ila. When a gentleman is called at night even it to be pierced with a spear, he should respond to the call. Muhammad said to his companions: As he comes down, I will extend my hands towards his head and when I hold him fast, you should do your job. So when he came down and he was holding his cloak under his arm, they said to him: We sense from you a very fine smell. He said: Yes, I have with me a mistress who is the most scented of the women of Arabia. He said: Allow me to smell (the scent on your head). He said: Yes, you may smell. So he caught it and smelt. Then he said: Allow me to do so (once again). He then held his head fast and said to his companions: Do your job. And they killed him.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4665,It has been narrated on the authority of Anas رضی اللہ عنہ :,"The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) raided Khaibar. One morning we offered prayers in the darkness of early dawn (near Khaibar). Then the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) mounted (his horse). Abu Talha رضی اللہ عنہ mounted his and I mounted behind Abu Talha رضی اللہ عنہ on the same horse. The Prophet of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) rode through the streets of Khaibar and (I rode so close to him) that my knee touched the thigh of the Prophet of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). The wrapper got aside from his thigh, and I could see its whiteness. When he entered the town, he said: God is Great. Khaibar shall face destruction. When we descend in the city-square of a people, it is a bad day for them who have been warned (and have not taken heed). He said these words thrice. The people of the town had just come out from (their houses) to go about their jobs. They said (in surprise): Muhammad has come.

They shouted (in surprise): Muhammad has come along with his force! The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: Khaibar shall face destruction.

4668,It has been narrated on the authority of Salama bin al-Akwa' رضی اللہ عنہ who said:,"We marched upon Khaibar with the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). We journeyed during the night. One of the people said to (my brother) 'Amir bin al-Akwa' رضی اللہ عنہ : Won't you recite to us some of your verses? Amir رضی اللہ عنہ was a poet. So he began to chant his verses to urge the camels, reciting: O God, if Thou hadst not guided us We would have neither been guided rightly nor practised charity, Nor offered prayers. We wish to lay down our lives for Thee; so forgive Thou our lapses, And keep us steadfast when we encounter (our enemies). Bestow upon us peace and tranquillity. Behold, when with a cry they called upon us to help. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Who is this driver (of the camels)? They said: It is 'Amir. He said: God will show mercy to him. A man said: Martyrdom is reserved for him. Messenger of Allah, would that you had allowed us to benefit ourselves from his life. (The narrator says): We reached Khaibar and besieged them, and (we continued the siege) until extreme hunger afflicted us. Then the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Behold, God has conquered it for you. When it was evening of the day on which the city was conquered. the Muslims lit many fires. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: What are these fires? And what are they cooking? They said: They are cooking meat. He asked. Which meat? They said: That of domestic asses. He said: Let them throw it away and break the pots (in which it is being cooked). A man said: Or should they throw it away and wash the pots? He said: They may do that. When the people drew themselves up in battle array 'Amir رضی اللہ عنہ caught hold of his sword that was rather short He drove a Jew before him to strike him with it. (As he struck him), his sword recoiled and struck his own knee, and 'Amirرضی اللہ عنہ died of the wound. When the people returned (after the conquest of Kliaibar) and he (Salama) had caught hold of my hand, and said: The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) saw that I was silent (and dejected) ; he said: What's the matter with thee? I said to him: My father and my mother be thy ransom, people presume that 'Amir's sacrifice has been in vain. He asked: Who has said that? I said: So and so and Usaid bin Hudair al-Ansari رضی اللہ عنہ . He said: Who has said that has lied. For him (for 'Amir) there is a double reward. (He indicated this by putting two of his fingers together.) He was a devotee of God and a warrior fighting for His cause. There will be hardly any Arab who can fight as bravely as he did. Qutaiba has differed in a few words.",The Book Of Jihad And Expeditions,Sahih Muslim,5,Sahih
4669,It has been reported on the authority of Salama bin Akwa' رضی اللہ عنہ who said:,"On the day of the Battle of Khaibar my brother fought a fierce fight by the side of the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). His sword rebounded and killed him. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon hill) talked about his death and doubted (whether it was martyrdom). (They said): (He is) a man killed by his own weapon, and expressed doubt about his affair. Salama said: When the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) returned from Khaibar, I said: Messenger of Allah, permit me that I may recite to you some rajaz verses. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) permitted him. 'Umar bin Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ said: I know what you will recite. I recited: By God, if God had guided us not, We would hive neither been guided aright nor practiced charity, Nor offered prayers. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: What you have said is true, 'I (continued): And descend on us peace and tranquillity And keep us steadfast if we encounter (with our enemies) And the polytheists have rebelled against us. When I finished my rajaz, the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: Who composed these verses? I said: They were composed by my brother. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: May God show mercy to him! I said: By God, some people are reluctant to invoke God's mercy on him (because) they say he is a man who died by his own sword. (Hearing this) the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: He died as God's devotee and warrior. Ibn Shihab has said: I asked one of the sons of Salama (bin Akwa') رضی اللہ عنہ about (the death of 'Amir). He related to me a similar tradition except that he said: When I said some people were reluctant invoke God's blessings on him, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: They lied.
