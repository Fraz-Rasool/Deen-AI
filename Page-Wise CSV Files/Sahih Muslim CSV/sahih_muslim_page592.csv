7511,Suhaib رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) thus said: There lived a king before you and he had a (court) magician. As he (the magician) grew old, he said to the king: I have grown old, send some young boy to me so that I should teach him magic. He (the king) sent to him a young man so that he should train him (in magic). And on his way (to the magician) he (the young man) found a monk sitting there. He (the young man) listened to his (the monk's) talk and was impressed by it. It became his habit that on his way to the magician he met the monk and set there and he came to the magician (late). He (the magician) beat him because of delay. He made a complaint of that to the monk and he said to him: When you feel afraid of the magician, say: Members of my family had detained me. And when you feel afraid of your family you should say: The magician had detained me. It so happened that there came a huge beast (of prey) and it blocked the way of the people, and he (the young boy) said: I will come to know today whether the magician is superior or the monk is superior. He picked up a stone and said: O Allah, if the affair of the monk is dearer to Thee than the affair of the magician, cause death to this animal so that the people should be able to move about freely. He threw that stone towards it and killed it and the people began to move about (on the path freely). He (the young man) then came to that monk and Informed him and the monk said: Sonny, today you are superior to me. Your affair has come to a stage where I find that you would be soon put to a trial, and in case you are put to a trial don't give my clue. That young man began to treat the blind and those suffering from leprosy and he in fact began to cure people from (all kinds) of illness. When a companion of the king who had gone blind heard about him, he came to him with numerous gifts and said: If you cure me all these things collected together here would be yours. Be said: I myself do not cure anyone. It is Allah Who cures and if you affirm faith in Allah, I shall also supplicate Allah to cure you. He affirmed his faith in Allah and Allah cured him and he came to the king and sat by his side as he used to sit before. The king said to him: Who restored your eyesight? He said: My Lord. Thereupon he said: It means that your Lord is One besides me. He said: My Lord and your Lord is Allah, so he (the king) took hold of him and tormented him till he gave a clue of that boy. The young man was thus summoned and the king said to him: O boy, it has been conveyed to me that you have become so much proficient in your magic that you cure the blind and those suffering from leprosy and you do such and such things. Thereupon he said: I do not cure anyone; it is Allah Who cures, and he (the king) took hold of him and began to torment him. So he gave a clue of the monk. The monk was thus summoned and it was said to him: You should turn back from your religion. He, however, refused to do so. He (ordered) for a saw to be brought (and when it was done) he (the king) placed it in the middle of his head and tore it into parts till a part fell down. Then the courtier of the king was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. Arid he refused to do so, and the saw was placed in the midst of his head and it was torn till a part fell down. Then that young boy was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. He refused to do so and he was handed over to a group of his courtiers. And he 'said to them: Take him to such and such mountain; make him climb up that mountain and when you reach its top (ask him to renounce his faith) but if he refuses to do so, then throw him (down the mountain). So they took him and made him climb up the mountain and he said: O Allah, save me from them (in any way) Thou likest and the mountain began to quake and they all fell down and that person came walking to the king. The king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them. He again handed him to some of his courtiers and said: Take him and carry him in a small boat and when you reach the middle of the ocean (ask him to renounce) his religion, but if he does not renounce his religion throw him (into the water). So they took him and he said: O Allah, save me from them and what they want to do. It was quite soon that the boat turned over and they were drowned and he came walking to the king, and the king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them, and he said to the king: You cannot kill me until you do what I ask you to do. And he said: What is that? He said: You should gather people in a plain and hang me by the trunk (of a tree). Then take hold of an arrow from the quiver and say: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the young boy; then shoot an arrow and if you do that then you would be able to kill me. So he (the king) called the people in an open plain and tied him (the boy) to the trunk of a tree, then he took hold of an arrow from his quiver and then placed the arrow in the bow and then said: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the young boy; he then shot an arrow and it bit his temple. He (the boy) placed his hands upon the temple where the arrow had bit him and he died and the people said: We affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man. The courtiers came to the king and it was said to him: Do you see that Allah has actually done what you aimed at averting. They (the people) have affirmed their faith in the Lord. He (the king) commanded ditches to be dug at important points in the path. When these ditches were dug, and the fire was lit in them it was said (to the people): He who would not turn back from his (boy's) religion would be thrown in the fire or it would be said to them to jump in that. (The people courted death but did not renounce religion) till a woman came with her child and she felt hesitant in jumping into the fire and the child said to her: O mother, endure (this ordeal) for it is the Truth.",The Book of Zuhd and Softening of Hearts,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7512,Ubadah bin Walid bin Samit reported:,"I and my father set out in search of knowledge to a tribe of the Ansar before their death (i.e. before the Companions of the Prophet left the world) and I was the first to meet Abu Yasar رضی اللہ عنہ, a Companion of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and there was a young man with him who carried the record of letters with him and there was a mantle prepared by the tribe of Ma'afiri upon him. And his servant too had a Ma'afiri mantle over him. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mother's bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (Abu'I-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow.",The Book of Zuhd and Softening of Hearts,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7513,Ubaidah bin Walid bin 'Ubaidah bin As Samit reported:,"I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Ma'afir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him. He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection.",The Book of Zuhd and Softening of Hearts,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7514,,"We went on till we came to Jabir bin Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہ in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allah's Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques.",The Book of Zuhd and Softening of Hearts,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7515,Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"We set out along with Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi bin 'Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allah's Messenger, it' is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Don't curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded.",The Book of Zuhd and Softening of Hearts,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7516,Jabir bin Abdullah رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"We set out on an expedition along with Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allah's Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar bin Sakhr رضی اللہ عنہ stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allah's Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar bin Sakhr رضی اللہ عنہ came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). Then Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allah's Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body.",The Book of Zuhd and Softening of Hearts,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7517,Jabir reported:,We set out on an expedition with Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that.,The Book of Zuhd and Softening of Hearts,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7518,Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"We set out on an expedition along with Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ said: I was afraid lest Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad bin Abbad has used the word faitab'd and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Isma'il pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allah's Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them. I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allah's Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this tormenty as long as these twigs remain fresh.",The Book of Zuhd and Softening of Hearts,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7519,Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ said:,"We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ, call people for performing wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allah's Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skin's,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and said: Allah's Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ , take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full.",The Book of Zuhd and Softening of Hearts,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih

We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our heart's content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.",The Book of Zuhd and Softening of Hearts,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7521,Al-Bara' bin 'Azib رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"Abu Bakr Siddiq رضی اللہ عنہ came to the residence of my father ('Azib) and bought a haudaj from him and said to 'Azib رضی اللہ عنہ: Send your son to my residence (to carry this haudaj), and my father said to me: Carry it (for him). So I carried it and there went along with him (with Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ) my father in order to fetch its price and he ('Azib رضی اللہ عنہ) said to Abu Bakr: Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ, narrate to me what you both did on the night when you set out on a journey along with Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). He said: We set out during the night and went on walking until it was noon, and the path was vacant and so none passed by that (until) there appeared prominently before us a large rock. It had its shade and the rays of the sun did not reach that place. So we got down at that place. I then went to the rock and levelled the ground with my hands at the place where the Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) would take rest under its shade. I then set the bedding and said: Allah's Messenger, go to sleep and I shall keep a watch around you. I went out and watched around him. There we saw a shepherd moving towards that rock with his flock and he intended what we intended (i. e. taking rest). I met him and said to him: Young boy, to which place do you belong? He said: I am a person from Medina. I said, is there any milk in the udders of your sheep and goats? He said: Yes. He took hold of a goat, and I said to him: Clean the udder well so that it should be free from hair, dust and impurity. I saw al-Bara' striking his hand upon the other (to give an indication) how he did that. He milked the goat for me in a wooden cup which he had with him and I had with me a bucket in which I kept water for drinking and for performing ablution. I came to Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and did not like to awaken him from sleep but he was accidentally startled from the sleep. I poured water upon the milk (till It was cold) and I said: Allah's Messenger, take this milk. He then took It and I was delighted and he (the Holy Prophet) said: Is now not the time to march on? I said: Of course. So he marched on after the sun had passed the meridian and Suraqa bin Malik pursued us and we had been walking on soft, level ground. I said: Allah's Messenger, we are about to be overtaken by them. Thereupon he said: Be not grieved. Verily, Allah is with us. Then Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) cursed him and his horse sank into the earth. I think he also said: I know you have hurled curse upon me. So supplicate Allah for me and I take an oath that I shall turn everyone away who would come in search of you. So he (Allah's Messenger) supplicated Allah and he was rescued and he came back and to everyone he met, he said: I have combed all this side. In short, he diverted everyone whom he met and he in fact fulfilled his promise.",The Book of Zuhd and Softening of Hearts,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7522,Al-Bara' رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ purchased a saddle from me for thirteen dirhams; the rest of the hadith is the same, and in the narration of Uthman bin 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ, the words are: He (Suraqa bin Malik) drew near Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ), and he (the Holy Prophet) cursed him and his camel sank in the earth up to the belly and he jumped from that and said: Muhammad, I am fully aware of It that it is your doing. Supplicate Allah that He should rescue me from it in which I am (pitchforked) and I give you a solemn pledge that I shall keep this as a secret from all those who are coming after me. Take hold of an arrow out of it (quiver) for you will find my camels and my slaves at such and such place and you can get whatever you need (on showing this arrow). He (the Holy Prophet) said: I don't need your camels. And we (the Prophet and Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ ) came to Medina during the night and the people began to contend as to where Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) should reside and he encamped in the tribe of Najjar who were related to 'Abd ul-Muttalib from the side of mother.
