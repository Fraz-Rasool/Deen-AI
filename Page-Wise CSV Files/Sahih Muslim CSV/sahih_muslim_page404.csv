(Once) when the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ) was in Ji'rana and there was a cloth which provided shade over him, and there were his Companions with him. 'Umar being one of them, there came a person with a cloak of wool on him daubed with perfume and he said: Messenger of Allah, what about the person who entered upon the state of Ihram with a cloak after daubing it with perfume? The Apostle of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) looked at him for a short while, and then became quiet, and revelation began descending upon him, and 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ gestured (with his hand) to Ya'la bin Umayya to come. Ya'la came and he entered his head (beneath the cloth and saw) the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) with his face red, and breathing heavily. Then he felt relieved (of that burden) and he said: Where is the man who was just asking me about Umra? The man was searched for and he was brought, and the Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) said: So far as the perfume is concerned, wash it three times, and remove the cloak too (as it was sewn) and do in 'Umra as you do in Hajj.",The Book of Pilgrimage,Sahih Muslim,3,Sahih

He said: I put on Ihram for 'Umra and I am in this state as you see (with dyed beard and head and a cloak over me).

And 'Umar screened him and it was (usual) with 'Umar that when the revelation descended upon him, he provided him shade (with the help of a piece of cloth). I (the person who came to the Holy Prophet) said: I said to 'Umar I wish to project my head into the cloth (to see how the Prophet receives revelation). So when the revelation began to descend upon him 'Umar wrapped him (the Holy Prophet) with cloth I came to him and projected my head with him into the cloth, and saw him (the Holy Prophet) (receiving the revelation). When he (the Holy Prophet) was relieved (of its burden), he said: Where is the inquirer who was just inquiring about 'Umra? That man came to him.
