He said: It was in fact so, but when during the caliphate of 'Umar (رضی اللہ عنہ ) people began to pronounce divorce frequently, he allowed them to do so (to treat pronouncements of three divorces in a single breath as one).",The Book of Divorce,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih

She ('A'isha رضی اللہ عنہا further) said: I and Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا agreed that one whom Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) would visit first should say: I notice that you have an odour of the Maghafir (gum of mimosa). He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) visited one of them and she said to him like this, whereupon he said: I have taken honey in the house of Zainab bint Jabsh and I will never do it again. It was at this (that the following verse was revealed): 'Why do you hold to be forbidden what Allah has made lawful for you... (up to). If you both ('A'isha and Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا ) turn to Allah up to: And when the Prophet confided an information to one of his wives (lxvi. 3).

He entered upon Hafsah رضی اللہ عنہا and stayed there longer than he usually did. I asked about that and I was told that a woman from among her people had given her a small vessel of honey as a gift, and she had poured some of the prophet to drink. I said: 'By Allah, we will play a trick on him. I mention that to Sawdah رضی اللہ عنہا and said: 'When he enter upon you, will get close to you, so they to him: ""O Messenger of Allah, you have eaten Maghafir?"" He will say to you: ""No."" So say to him: ""What is this smell?"" -for the Messenger of Allah hated to have any smell coming from him -He will tell you: ""Hafsah رضی اللہ عنہا poured me a drink of honey."" I will say that to him too, and you say it as well, O Safiyyah.' Then he entered upon Sawdah رضی اللہ عنہا."" She said: ""Sawdah رضی اللہ عنہا used to say: 'By the one besides Whom there is none worthy of worship, I nearly decided to tell him what you had told me to say, when he was at the door, but I was afraid of you.' When the Messenger of Allah drew closed, she said: 'O Messenger of Allah, have you eaten Maghafir?' He said: 'No.' She said: 'Then what is this smell?' He said: 'Then what is this smell?' He said: 'Hafsah رضی اللہ عنہا poured me a drink of honey.' She said: 'The bees must have sipped the nectar of Al-'Urfut.' When he entered upon me, I said the same thing, then he entered upon Safiyyah رضی اللہ عنہاand she said the same thing. When he entered upon Hafsah رضی اللہ عنہا she said: O Messenger of Allah, shall I pour you some?' He said: 'I have no need of it.'""",The Book of Divorce,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih

She said that he already knew that my parents would never allow me to seek separation from him She said: Then he said: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said: Prophet, say to thy wives: If you desire this world's life and its adornment, then come, I will give you a provision and allow you to depart a goodly departing; and if you desire Allah and His Messenger and the abode of the Hereafter, then Allah has prepared for the doers of good among you a great reward She is reported to have said: About what should I consult my parents, for I desire Allah and His Messenger and the abode of the Hereafter?

3690,Jabir bin 'Abdullah (رضی اللہ عنہ) reported:,"Abu Bakr (رضی اللہ عنہ) came and sought permission to see Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). He found people sitting at his door and none amongst them had been granted permission, but it was granted to Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ and he went in. Then came 'Umar and he sought permission and it was granted to him, and he found Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) sitting sad and silent with his wives around him. He (Hadrat 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ) said: I would say something which would make the Prophet ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) laugh, so he said: Messenger of Allah ﷺ, I wish you had seen (the treatment meted out to) the daughter of Khadija when you asked me some money, and I got up and slapped her on her neck. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) laughed and said: They are around me as you see, asking for extra money. Abu Bakr (رضی اللہ عنہ) then got up went to 'A'isha (رضی اللہ عنہا) and slapped her on the neck, and 'Umar stood up before Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا and slapped her saying: You ask Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) which he does not possess. They said: By Allah, we do not ask Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) for anything he does not possess. Then he withdrew from them for a month or for twenty-nine days. Then this verse was revealed to him: Prophet ﷺ: Say to thy wives... for a mighty reward (xxxiii. 28). He then went first to 'A'isha (رضی اللہ عنہا) and said: I want to propound something to you, 'A'isha رضی اللہ عنہا , but wish no hasty reply before you consult your parents. She said: Messenger of Allah ﷺ, what is that? He (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) recited to her the verse, whereupon she said: Is it about you that I should consult my parents, Messenger of Allah ﷺ? Nay, I choose Allah, His Messenger, and the Last Abode; but I ask you not to tell any of your wives what I have said He replied: Not one of them will ask me without my informing her. God did not send me to be harsh, or cause harm, but He has sent me to teach and make things easy.",The Book of Divorce,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih
3691,Umar bin al-Khattab ( رضی اللہ عنہ) reported:,"When Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) kept himself away from his wives, I entered the mosque, and found people striking the ground with pebble sand saying: Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) has divorced his wives, and that was before they were commanded to observe seclusion 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said to himself: I must find this (actual position) today. So I went to 'A'isha (رضی اللہ عنہا) and said (to her): Daughter of Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ, have you gone to the extent of giving trouble to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌)? Thereupon she said: Son of Khattab, you have nothing to do with me, and I have nothing to do with you. You should look to your own receptacle. He ('Umar رضی اللہ عنہ) said: I visited Hafsa daughter of 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ , and said to her: Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا , the (news) has reached me that you cause Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) trouble. You know that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) does not love you, and had I not been (your father) he would have divorced you. (On hearing this) she wept bitterly. I said to her: Where is Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ )? She said: He is in the attic room. I went in and found Rabah, the servant of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ), sitting on the thresholds of the window dangling his feet on the hollow wood of the date-palm with the help of which Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) climbed (to the apartment) and came down. I cried: O Rabah, seek permission for me from Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him). Rabah cast a glance at the apartment and then looked toward me but said nothing. I again said: Rabah, seek permission for me from Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). Rabah looked towards the apartment and then cast a glance at me, but said nothing. I then raised my voice and said: 0 Rabah, seek permission for me from Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). I think that Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) is under the impression that I have come for the sake of Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا . By Allah, if Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) would command me to strike her neck, I would certainly strike her neck. I raised my voice and he pointed me to climb up (and get into his apartment). I visited Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌), and he was lying on a mat. I sat down and he drew up his lower garment over him and he had nothing (else) over him, and that the mat had left its marks on his sides. I looked with my eyes in the store room of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌). I found only a handful of barley equal to one sa' and an equal quantity of the leaves of Mimosa Flava placed in the nook of the cell, and a semi-tanned leather bag hanging (in one side), and I was moved to tears (on seeing this extremely austere living of the Holy Prophet), and he said: Ibn Khattab رضی اللہ عنہ, what wakes you weep? I said: Apostle of Allah, why should I not shed tears? This mat has left its marks on your sides and I do not see in your store room (except these few things) that I have seen; Ceasar and Closroes are leading their lives in plenty whereas you are Allah's Messenger. His chosen one, and that is your store! He said: Ibn Khattab, aren't you satisfied that for us (there should be the prosperity) of the Hereafter, and for them (there should be the prosperity of) this world? I said: Yes. And as I had entered I had seen the signs of anger on his face, and I therefore, said: Messenger of Allah, what trouble do you feel from your wives, and if youhave divorced them, verily Allah is with you, His angels, Gabriel, Mika'il, I and Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ and the believers are with you. And seldom I talked and (which I uttered on that day) I hoped that Allah would testify to my words that I uttered. And so the verse of option (Ayat al-Takhyir) was revealed. Maybe his Lord, if he divorce you, will give him in your place wives better than you... (Ixv. 5). And if you back up one another against him, then surely Allah is his Patron, and Gabriel and the righteous believers, and the angels after that are the aidera (lvi. 4). And it was 'A'isha, daughter of Abu Bakr رضی اللہ عنہ , and Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا who had prevailed upon all the wives of Allah's Prophet (way peace be upon him) for (pressing them for mote money). I said: Messenger of Allah, have you divorced them? He said: No. I said: Messenger of Allah, I entered the mosque and found the Muslims playing with pebbles (absorbed in thought) and saying: Allah's Messenger has divorced his wives. Should I get down and inform there that you have not divorced them? He said: Yes, if you so like. And I went on talking to him until I (found) the signs of anger disappeared on his face and (his seriousness was changed to a happy mood and as a result thereof) his face had the natural tranquillity upon it and he laughed and his teeth were the most charming (among the teeth) of all people. Then Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) climbed down and I also climbed down and catching hold of the wood of the palm-tree and Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) came down (with such ease) as if he was walking on the ground, not touching anything with his hand (to get support). I said: Messenger of Allah, you remained in your apartment for twenty-nine days. He said: (At times) the month consists of twenty-nine days. I stood at the door of the mosque and I called out at the top of my voice: The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) has not divorced his wives (and it was on this occasion that this) verse was revealed: And if any matter pertaining to peace or alarm comes within their ken, they broadcast it; whereas, if they would refer it to the Apostle and those who have been entrusted with authority amongst them, those of them who are engaged in obtaining intelligence would indeed know (what to do with) it (iv 83). And it was I who understood this matter, and Allah revealed the verse pertaining to option (given to the Prophet (may peace be upon him in regard to the retaining or divorcing of his wives).",The Book of Divorce,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih
3692,Abdullah bin Abbas ( رضی اللہ عنہ) reported:,"I intended to ask 'Umar bin al-Khattab ( رضی اللہ عنہ) about a verse, but I waited for one year to ask him out of his fear, until he went out for Pilgrimage and I also accompanied him. As he came back and we were on the way he stepped aside towards an Arak tree to ease himself. I waited for him until he was free. I then walked along with him and said: Commander of the Faithful, who are the two among the wives of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) who backed up one another (in their demand for extra money)? He said: They were Hafsa and 'A'isha (رضی اللہ عنہا ). I said to him: It is for one year that I intended to ask you about this matter but I could not date so on account of the awe for you. He said: Don't do that. If you think that I have any knowledge, do ask me about that. And if I were to know that, I would inform you. He (the narrator) stated that 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ had said: By Allah, during the days of ignorance we had no regard for women until Allah the Exalted revealed about them what He has revealed, and appointed (turn) for them what he appointed. He said: It so happened that I was thinking about some matter that my wife said: I wish you had done that and that. I said to her: It does not concern you and you should not feel disturbed in a matter which I intend to do. She said to me: How strange is it that you, O son of Khattab, do not like anyone to retort upon you, whereas your daughter retorts upon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) until he spends the day in vexation. 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ said: I took hold of my cloak, then came out of my house until I visited Hafsa and said to her: O daughter, (I heard) that you retort upon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) until he spends the day in vexation, whereupon Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا said: By Allah, we do retort upon him. I said: You should bear in mind, my daughter, that I warn you against the punishment of Allah and the wrath of His Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). You may not be misled by one whose beauty has fascinated her, and the love of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) for her. I ('Umar رضی اللہ عنہ) then visited Umm Salama رضی اللہ عنہا because of my relationship with her and I talked to her. Umm Salama رضی اللہ عنہا said to me: Umar bin al-Khattab رضی اللہ عنہا , how strange is it that you meddle with every matter so much so that you are anxious to interfere between Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) and his wives, and this perturbed me so much that I refrained from saying what I had to say, so I came out of her apartment, and I had a friend from the Anar. When I had been absent (from the company of the Holy Prophet ﷺ) he used to bring me the news and when he had been absent I used to bring him the news, and at that time we dreaded a king of Ghassan. It was mentioned to us that he intended to attack us, and our minds were haunted by him. My friend, the Ansari, came to me, and he knocked at the door and said: Open it, open it. I said: Has the Ghassani come? He said: (The matter is) more serious than that. The Messenger of Allah ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) has separated himself from his wives. I said: Let the nose of Hafsa رضی اللہ عنہا and 'A'isha رضی اللہ عنہا be besmeared with dust. I then took hold of my cloth and went out until I came and found Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) in his attic to which he climbed by means of a ladder made of date-palm, and the servant of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) who was black had been sitting at the end of the ladder. I said: This is Umar. So permission was granted to me. I narrated this news to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and as I narrated the news concerning Umm Salama رضی اللہ عنہا , Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) smiled. He was lying on the mat and there was nothing between him and that (mat), and under his head there was a pillow made of leather and it was stuffed with plam fibres and at his feet were lying a heap of sant tree (acacia niloctica, meant for dyeing) and near his head there was hanging a hide. And I saw the marks of the maton the side of Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ), and so I wept. He said: What makes you weep? I said: Messenger of Allah, the Khusrau and the Ceasars (spendd their lives in) the midst of (luxuries), whereas you being Allah's Messenger (are leading your life in this poverty). Thereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: Don't you like that they should have riches of their world, and you have the Hereafter.",The Book of Divorce,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih
3693,Ibn Abbas ( رضی اللہ عنہ) said:,"I came along with Umar رضی اللہ عنہ until we reached Marr al-Zahran (the name of a place), and the rest of the hadith is the same as narrated by Sulaiman bin Bilal (except with) the variation (of words) that I said: (What) about these two women? He said: They were Hafsa and Umm Salama رضی اللہ عنھن . And he made this addition: I came to the apartments and in every apartment there was (the noise) of weeping. And this addition was also made: And he (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) had taken an oath of remaining away from them for a month, and when twenty-nine days had passed, he visited them.",The Book of Divorce,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih
3694,Ibn Abbas رضی اللہ عنہ said:,"""I wanted to ask 'Umar رضی اللہ عنہ about the two women who helped one another at the time of the Messenger of Allah, but for one year I could not find any opportunity, until I accompanied him to Makkah. When he was in Marr Az-Zahran, he went to relieve himself, and he said: 'Bring me a jug of water.' So I brought it to him, and when he had relieved himself and came back, I went to pour water for him, then I remembered and said to him: O commander of the Believers, who were the two women?' And I do not finish what I was saying before he said: ""Aishah and Hafsah رضی اللہ عنھن .""",The Book of Divorce,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih

I said: Messenger of Allah, you had taken an oath that you would not visit us for a month, while you have visited after I have counted only twenty-nine (nights).

He said: There is no maintenance due to you from him, and he commanded her to spend the 'Idda in the house of Umm Sharik رضی اللہ عنہا , but then said: That is a woman whom my companions visit. So better spend this period in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum رضی اللہ عنہ , for he is a blind man and yon can put off your garments. And when the 'Idda is over, inform me. She said: When my period of 'Idda was over, I mentioned to him that Mu'awiya bin Abu Sufyan and Jahm had sent proposal of marriage to me, whereupon Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: As for Abu Jahm رضی اللہ عنہم , he does not put down his staff from his shoulder, and as for Mu'awiya, he is a poor man having no property; marry Usama bin Zaid رضی اللہ عنہ . I objected to him, but he again said: Marry Usama; so I married him. Allah blessed there in and I was envied (by others).",The Book of Divorce,Sahih Muslim,4,Sahih
