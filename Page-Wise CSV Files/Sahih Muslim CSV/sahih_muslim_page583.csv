7278,Abu Huraira رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) as saying: The Last Hour would not come until the Romans would land at al-A'maq or in Dabiq. An army consisting of the best (soldiers) of the people of the earth at that time will come from Medina (to counteract them). When they will arrange themselves in ranks, the Romans would say: Do not stand between us and those (Muslims) who took prisoners from amongst us. Let us fight with them; and the Muslims would say: Nay, by Allah, we would never get aside from you and from our brethren that you may fight them. They will then fight and a third (part) of the army would run away, whom Allah will never forgive. A third (part of the army) which would be constituted of excellent martyrs in Allah's eye, would be killed and the third who would never be put to trial would win and they would be conquerors of Constantinople. And as they would be busy in distributing the spoils of war (amongst themselves) after hanging their swords by the olive trees, the Satan would cry: The Dajjal has taken your place among your family. They would then come out, but it would be of no avail. And when they would come to Syria, he would come out while they would be still preparing themselves for battle drawing up the ranks. Certainly, the time of prayer shall come and then Jesus (peace be upon him) son of Mary would descend and would lead them in prayer. When the enemy of Allah would see him, it would (disappear) just as the salt dissolves itself in water and if he (Jesus) were not to confront them at all, even then it would dissolve completely, but Allah would kill them by his hand and he would show them their blood on his lance (the lance of Jesus Christ).",The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7279,Mustaurid al-Qurashi رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"I heard Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) as saying: The Last Hour would come (when) the Romans would form a majority amongst people. 'Amr said to him (Mustaurid Qurashi): See what you are saying? He said: I say what I heard from Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). Thereupon he said: If you say that, it is a fact for they have four qualities. They have the patience to undergo a trial and immediately restore themselves to sanity after trouble and attack again after flight. They (have the quality) of being good to the destitute and the orphans, to the weak and, fifthly, the good quality in them is that they put resistance against the oppression of kings.",The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7280,Mustaurid Qurashi رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"I heard Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) as saying: The Last Hour would come when the Romans would form a majority amongst people. This reached 'Amr bin al-'As رضی اللہ عنہ and he said: What are these ahadith which are being transmitted from you and which you claim to have heard from Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌)? Mustaurid رضی اللہ عنہ said to him: I stated only that which I heard from Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ). Thereupon 'Amr رضی اللہ عنہ said: If you state this (it is true), for they have the power of tolerance amongst people at the time of turmoil and restore themselves to sanity after trouble, and are good amongst people so far as the destitute and the weak are concerned.",The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour,Sahih Muslim,6,Sahih
7281,Yusair bin Jabir رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"Once there blew a red storm in Kufah that there came a person who had nothing to say but (these words): `Abdullah bin Mas`ud رضی اللہ عنہ , the Last Hour has come. He (`Abdullah bin Mas`ud رضی اللہ عنہ ) was sitting reclining against something, and he said: The Last Hour would not come until shares of inheritance are not distributed and there is no rejoicing over spoils of war. Then he said pointing towards Syria, with the gesture of his hand like this: The enemy shall muster strength against Muslims and the Muslims will muster strength against them (Syrians). I said: You mean Rome? And he said: Yes, and there would be a terrible fight and the Muslims would prepare a detachment (for fighting unto death) which would not return but victorious. They will fight until night will intervene them; both the sides will return without being victorious and both will be wiped out. The Muslims will again prepare a detachment for fighting unto death so that they may not return but victorious. When it would be the fourth day, a new detachment out of the remnant of the Muslims would be prepared and Allah will decree that the enemy should be routed. And they would fight such a fight the like of which would not be seen, so much so that even if a bird were to pass their flanks, it would fall down dead before reaching the end of them. (There would be such a large scale massacre) that when counting would be done, (only) one out of a hundred men related to one another would be found alive. So what can be the joy at the spoils of such war and what inheritance would be divided! They would be in this very state that they would hear of a calamity more horrible than this. And a cry would reach them: The Dajjal has taken your place among your offspring. They will, therefore, throw away what would be in their hands and go forward sending ten horsemen, as a scouting party. Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) said: I know their names and the names of their forefathers and the color of their horses. They will be the best horsemen on the surface of the earth on that day or amongst the best horsemen on the surface of the earth on that day.

7284,Nafi' bin Utba رضی اللہ عنہ reported:,"We were with Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) in an expedition that there came a people to Allah's Apostle ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) from the direction of the west. They were dressed in woollen clothes and they stood near a hillock and they met him as Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌) was sitting. I said to myself: Better go to them and stand between him and them that they may not attack him. Then I thought that perhaps there had been going on secret negotiation amongst them. I however, went to them and stood between them and him and I remember four of the words (on that occasion) which I repeat (on the fingers of my hand) that he (Allah's Messenger) said: You will attack Arabia and Allah will enable you to conquer it, then you would attack Persia and He would make you to conquer it. Then you would attack Rome and Allah will enable you to conquer it, then you would attack the Dajjal and Allah will enable you to conquer him.
